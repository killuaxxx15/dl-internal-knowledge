Ben Franklin: An American Life

Franklin's Self-Invented American Archetype

• Franklin consciously crafted his public persona as America's first great publicist, creating a new American archetype rooted in pragmatism, humor, and self-improvement rather than aristocratic pretension.
• He portrayed himself as "B. Franklin, printer" throughout his life, maintaining connection to the artisan class despite his achievements and rejecting hereditary aristocracy's pomposity.
• His carefully constructed image combined calculated public relations (carting paper through streets, wearing fur caps in France) with authentic virtue, making him relatable across generations.

Rebellion Against Authority and Establishment

• Franklin possessed an inbred allergy to authority from youth through his revolutionary years, refusing to be awed by rank or intimidated by powerful establishments.
• He preferred the company of lively minds with simple virtues over idle elites, consistently resisting his father's attempts to dampen his ambitions and limit his horizons.
• His natural instinct as a smooth operator rather than zealot meant he challenged authority through pragmatic action rather than dogmatic fervor.

Scientific Approach: Practical Over Theoretical

• Franklin's scientific work prioritized discovering facts and practical applications over abstract theory, declining patents to freely share inventions for the common good.
• His achievements spanned electricity experiments (kite and lightning rod), bifocals, clean-burning stoves, Gulf Stream charts, and theories on contagious illness.
• He viewed inventions as debt repayment to society, believing benefits from others' innovations should be reciprocated freely and generously.

Thirteen Virtues and Character Development

• Franklin created a systematic self-improvement program with thirteen virtues including temperance, silence, order, resolution, frugality, industry, sincerity, justice, moderation, cleanliness, tranquility, chastity, and humility.
• He practiced focused improvement by concentrating on one virtue weekly while maintaining others, tracking progress in a little book.
• His moral framework emphasized actions benefiting the common good, valuing policies that increased community well-being and individual dignity over private wealth accumulation.

Mastering Human Nature and Influence

• Franklin developed sophisticated techniques for converting adversaries into allies, notably borrowing a rare book from an opponent who then became a lifelong friend.
• He learned that "he that once has done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another than he whom you yourself have obliged," leveraging reciprocity psychology.
• His maxims from Poor Richard's Almanac distilled wisdom from many ages, offering practical insights he found useful and amusing rather than claiming originality.

Strategic Retirement and Life Philosophy

• At age 42, precisely his life's midpoint, Franklin retired from his printing empire despite continued profitability, believing "I would rather have it said he lived usefully than he died rich."
• He structured a partnership providing half the shop's profits for 18 years, ensuring financial security without endless accumulation.
• Retirement enabled pursuit of science, politics, and diplomacy with undiminished ambition, embodying Poor Richard's maxim: "Lost time is never found again."
