What Could Possibly Go Wrong (with special guest Jim Lucier of Capital Alpha)

September Market Concerns

• Market may have peaked in late August, with September historically being a challenging month for stocks
• Current market weakness attributed to high valuations, seasonal factors, and uncertainty around Fed policy
• Gold reaching new record highs signals broader market unease and potential economic instability

Federal Reserve Rate Cut Expectations

• Markets expect Fed rate cut on September 17th, but recent economic data may complicate this decision
• Strong GDP growth (3%+ in Q3, revised up to 3.3% in Q2) and solid personal income data suggest economy remains resilient
• CPI inflation expected around 3% year-over-year, well above Fed's 2% target, potentially limiting aggressive rate cuts

Labor Market Assessment

• Job market appears balanced with continuing low layoffs and adequate job openings relative to unemployment
• Challenges exist for specific groups (teenagers, recent college graduates), possibly due to AI uncertainty and non-specific degree programs
• Expected August job gains around 100,000, which should be sufficient given current labor force dynamics

Trump Tariffs Court Ruling

• Federal Appeals Court ruled 7-4 that most Trump tariffs under IEEPA are unlawful and unconstitutional
• Case likely heading to Supreme Court, with uncertainty about whether tariffs remain in place during appeals process
• Potential for $150-350 billion in tariff refunds if Supreme Court upholds lower court ruling, creating complex administrative challenges

Broader Economic and Geopolitical Context

• Reduced illegal immigration and increased deportations constraining labor supply, potentially supporting wage growth
• Ongoing geopolitical tensions with no progress on Ukraine-Russia ceasefire or Middle East peace
• India tariffs pushing that country closer to China and Russia, contrary to U.S. strategic interests
