Adi Dassler (Adidas)

The Dassler Brothers' Rise and Split

• Adi and Rudolf Dassler built their shoe business from their mother's laundry room in a small Bavarian town after WWI, transforming from a family weaving business to sports footwear pioneers.
• The brothers ruled the sports business for decades from their medieval village, with their shoes featured in nearly all emblematic sports history photos.
• A blazing fight caused Rudolf to walk across the river and establish Puma as a competing brand, creating a family feud that shaped the modern sports business and introduced corruption and escalating financial stakes.
• Their rivalry distracted both families so severely that they ignored Nike's rise in the 1980s, allowing the American upstart to capture the European sports business.

Adi Dassler's Craftsmanship and Innovation Philosophy

• Adi was an obsessive craftsman who registered nearly 700 patents over five decades, maintaining his focus on product improvement until his death at 78.
• He personally worked with individual athletes like Muhammad Ali, creating custom footwear and listening to customer needs even while running a massive company.
• His products were of such superior quality that even East German communists turned a blind eye to their capitalistic origins to use Adidas.
• Adi remained humble throughout his success, once pretending to be the gardener when strangers came looking for him, and admitted he didn't know or care how many factories Adidas owned.

The Cost of Family Rivalry

• The feud between Adi and Rudolf extended to their children and grandchildren, with cousins fighting each other while trying to run their respective companies.
• Armin Dassler (Rudolf's son) lost control of Puma to Deutsche Bank, which devastated him and his family believed ultimately led to his death at 61.
• Adi's son Horst created internal conflict by launching side businesses and taking resources from Adidas, leading to bitter letters where Adi disowned him.
• The author's key insight: entrepreneurship should be a force for good, but the Dasslers turned one of humanity's greatest inventions into a disastrous family liability that made everyone miserable.

Adi's Early Resourcefulness and Work Ethic

• After WWI left the family broke, Adi scavenged military supplies to make shoes, using old tents for canvas and soldiers' steel helmets cut into studs for traction.
• He designed innovative features like movable metal studs that could be screwed into soles, allowing athletes to adjust traction for different weather conditions.
• Adi personally attended sporting events to observe athletes and gather feedback, constantly seeking ways to improve his products based on real performance needs.
• His dedication to athletes earned him loyalty and respect, with top competitors visiting the small Bavarian town specifically to chat with him about shoe improvements.

The Competitive Advantage Through Athlete Relationships

• While competitors like Puma sold bulk orders to teams, Adi focused on building personal relationships with individual athletes and understanding their specific needs.
• His approach created organic brand advocacy as satisfied athletes naturally influenced their teammates and competitors to switch to Adidas.
• Adi maintained this hands-on approach even as Adidas grew massive, continuing to walk around with his notepad and tinker in his workshop into his 70s.
• By 1978, the company he founded in his mother's washroom produced 180,000 pairs daily and employed nearly 3,000 people in Germany alone.

The Human Cost of Business Obsession

• Adi continued playing soccer and tennis regularly despite medical advice to slow down, demonstrating his lifelong dedication to understanding athletes' experiences.
• He remained focused solely on product innovation and customer relationships, deliberately avoiding business honors and pompous recognition throughout his career.
• The company expanded dramatically under Adi's leadership, but his son Horst's empire-building and side ventures created destructive internal conflict in the family.
• Adi passed away in 1978 at age 78 following a stroke, with his funeral kept strictly private per his instructions to avoid "pompous speechmakers and intruders."
