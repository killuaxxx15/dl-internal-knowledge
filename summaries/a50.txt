World Gold Council Central Bank Gold Reserves Survey June 2025 - Comprehensive Summary

Survey Overview and Participation

• The 2025 Central Bank Gold Reserves (CBGR) survey achieved record participation with 73 responses, the highest since the survey commenced eight years ago
• The survey was conducted between February 25 and May 20, 2025, representing a highly representative sample of the global central banking community both geographically and in terms of gold ownership
• The sample included 15 advanced economy central banks (21%) and 58 emerging market and developing economy (EMDE) central banks (79%)
• Participation increase signals growing engagement with gold amongst the central banking community and adds depth to understanding of gold's role in reserve management
• The survey was conducted anonymously with unique links provided to central banks worldwide, excluding those under sanctions

Central Bank Gold Accumulation Trends

• Central banks have accumulated over 1,000 tonnes of gold in each of the last three years, significantly up from the 400-500 tonne average over the preceding decade
• This marked acceleration in gold accumulation has occurred against a backdrop of geopolitical and economic uncertainty
• A record 95% of respondents believe that global central bank gold reserves will increase over the next 12 months, up from 81% in 2024
• 43% of respondents expect their own institution's gold reserves to increase over the next year, up from 29% in 2024 and marking a new record high
• None of the survey respondents anticipate a decline in their gold reserves over the coming 12 months

Future Expectations for Gold in Reserve Portfolios

• 76% of respondents believe gold will hold a moderately or significantly higher share of total reserves five years from now, up from 69% in the previous year
• Responses were consistent between advanced economy and EMDE central banks, with the majority anticipating gold's proportion would be moderately higher in five years
• Gold's performance during times of crisis, portfolio diversification, and inflation hedging are key themes driving plans to accumulate more gold
• Gold's unique characteristics continue to be valued: its performance in crisis times, ability to act as a store of value, and role as an effective diversifier
• Central banks across both advanced and emerging economies are aligned in viewing gold's strategic importance for long-term reserve management

US Dollar Reserve Currency Outlook

• 73% of respondents expect the US dollar's share of global reserves to be lower five years from now, with both advanced economy and EMDE responses aligned in this view
• While the US dollar maintains its dominant position as the global reserve currency, IMF data shows its share has been on a gradual decline
• Respondents anticipate that the share of other currencies such as the euro and renminbi, as well as gold, will increase over the same five-year period
• The trend reflects ongoing concerns about US dollar dependence and desire for reserve diversification
• Despite expected decline, the dollar's role remains underpinned by deep financial markets, strong institutions, and lack of full substitute currencies

Strategic Considerations in Reserve Management

• 93% of respondents indicated "interest rate levels" as relevant to their reserve management decisions, consistent with previous surveys
• Higher percentages of EMDE respondents consider inflation concerns (84% vs 67% for advanced economies) and geopolitical instability (81% vs 60%) as top priorities
• 59% of total respondents indicated "potential trade conflicts/tariffs" are relevant, with a larger percentage from EMDE respondents (69%) than advanced economies (40%)
• Shifts in global economic power and concerns over unexpected shocks also feature prominently in strategic considerations
• The divergence between EMDE and advanced economy priorities reflects different risk exposures and economic challenges

Factors Driving Gold Holdings

• 85% of respondents indicated that gold's performance during times of crisis is highly or somewhat relevant to their organization's decision to hold gold
• 81% highlighted gold's attribute as a portfolio diversifier as a relevant factor, while 80% emphasized its role as a long-term store of value
• There's a notable divergence between EMDE and advanced economy central banks: 87% of EMDE respondents vs 77% of advanced economy respondents view crisis performance as most relevant
• 78% of EMDE respondents rated gold as a geopolitical diversifier as relevant, compared to just 46% of advanced economy respondents
• This divergence resonates with recent trends showing stronger appetite for gold accumulation from EMDE central banks

Technical and Operational Management Practices

• 75% of respondents manage gold separately from their other reserve assets, an increase from 67% in the previous year
• Gold as a strategic asset was the top response (64%) for why institutions manage gold separately, with advanced economy respondents unanimously selecting "historical legacy asset" as relevant
• 44% of respondents actively manage their gold reserves, a record high since the survey began in 2018
• 85% of those actively managing gold reserves indicated "enhancing returns" as the primary reason, while 22% selected "risk management" (up from 14% in 2024)
• Risk management has leapfrogged tactical trading as the second most selected reason for active gold management

Gold Storage and Vaulting Arrangements

• The Bank of England remains the most popular vaulting location for gold reserves among respondents at 64%, an increase from 55% in the previous year
• 59% of central bankers reported domestic storage of gold reserves in 2025, significantly higher than 41% in 2024
• Only 7% of respondents indicated plans to increase domestic storage of gold reserves over the next 12 months
• 83% of respondents indicated no change in custody arrangements over the past 12 months
• There's been a slight resurgence of "diversified overseas storage locations" as an option, not selected since 2022 until this year's survey

Gold Purchasing and Physical Forms

• London Good Delivery Bars continue to dominate central bankers' purchase of physical gold, with 56% of all respondents selecting this option
• 63% of EMDE respondents use Good Delivery bars for purchasing, while 31% of advanced economy respondents choose this method
• London Good Delivery bars remain the primary way central banks hold gold, with 88% selecting this option
• 22% of respondents have considered upgrading gold holdings that do not conform to Good Delivery standards, up from 19% in the previous year
• EMDE respondents also purchase gold doré and kilo bars, potentially representing domestic gold buying programmes

Domestic Gold Purchase Programmes

• Among central banks from countries with gold production, 56% of EMDE central bankers reported having domestic gold purchase programmes already in place
• 12% of EMDE respondents indicated they were considering establishing such programmes
• 14 central banks with existing domestic buying programmes refine their gold at LBMA Good Delivery List refineries, up from 11 the previous year
• Equal numbers of central banks (10 each) pay either spot international gold price or a discount to international gold price for their domestic gold
• These programmes represent how gold is purchased through domestic large-scale mining or artisanal and small-scale gold mining operations

Reserve Currency Composition Expectations

• Respondents expect the euro's share of total reserves to increase moderately over the next five years, with 43% anticipating higher allocation
• For Chinese renminbi, 54% of respondents expect its share to increase, though starting from a much smaller base of 2% currently
• Advanced economy and EMDE respondents showed similar expectations for currency composition changes
• The anticipated shifts reflect ongoing diversification away from traditional reserve currencies
• Gold is expected to benefit from this diversification trend as central banks seek alternatives to major fiat currencies
