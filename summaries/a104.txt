The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook: A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius, and Betrayal

Mark Zuckerberg's Early Programming Prowess

• Created multiple successful programs before Facebook including Synapse (an MP3 player plugin that Microsoft offered $1-2 million to buy), Course Match (allowing Harvard students to track class enrollments), and the controversial Facemash website
• Known as a "master hacker" in high school with alleged FBI attention, demonstrating exceptional coding abilities from an early age
• Displayed a pattern of turning to programming when frustrated, viewing his computer as the place where he had complete control and belonged

The Facemash Incident as Facebook's Genesis

• Created Facemash after being rejected by a girl, hacking into Harvard house databases to download thousands of student photos for a "hot or not" comparison site
• The site's explosive popularity (forcing shutdown within days) revealed intense interest in viewing and rating classmates online, inspiring the social network concept
• Harvard disciplined Mark with probation for the security breach, but the incident caught the attention of the Winklevoss twins who later hired him for their own social network project

Facebook's Launch Strategy and Early Growth

• Launched on February 4, 2004, targeting Phoenix final club members first to leverage their social influence, then expanding strategically to nearby schools to create demand
• Used clever tactics like the "Baylor strategy" - surrounding resistant schools with Facebook adoption to create peer pressure for joining
• Within 24 hours of launching at Stanford, 85% of students had joined after positive press coverage, demonstrating the platform's viral appeal

The Sean Parker Factor

• Parker immediately connected with Mark upon meeting, becoming his idol and mentor due to his Napster fame and Silicon Valley credibility
• Moved into the Palo Alto house with Mark and became Facebook's first president, facilitating the crucial $500,000 investment from Peter Thiel
• Created tension with Eduardo by emphasizing the need for total commitment to Facebook and criticizing Eduardo's divided attention between school and the company

Eduardo Saverin's Betrayal and Ouster

• Eduardo's freezing of Facebook's bank account during disputes marked a turning point, viewed by Parker and Mark as threatening the company's survival
• During reincorporation from LLC to C-corp, Mark diluted Eduardo's 30% stake to nearly nothing through massive new share issuances to himself, Parker, and Dustin Moskovitz
• The ambush at Facebook's new offices resulted in Eduardo being completely expelled from the company, removed from its history, and stripped of his founder status despite being there from the beginning

Silicon Valley vs. Harvard Mentality

• The book contrasts Mark's "all-in" approach (dropping out of Harvard) with Eduardo's traditional path (maintaining his internship and planning to return to school)
• Sean Parker embodied the Silicon Valley ethos that success comes from total commitment rather than business classes, citing dropouts like Bill Gates as examples
• Eduardo's attempt to balance Facebook with other commitments was viewed as incompatible with the company's needs during its critical growth phase
