AI: Mad Maths - The Capital Cycle Podcast

Massive Scale of AI Investment

• Morgan Stanley estimates $3 trillion in cumulative data center investment from 2025-2028 (excluding energy costs), while McKinsey projects over $5 trillion through 2030
• The stock market has added $12 trillion in value to 10 major US tech firms since ChatGPT's 2022 release, implying a Tobin's Q ratio of 2-4x
• Current investment levels mirror the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, raising concerns about excessive capital deployment and future competition

Math Doesn't Add Up

• To justify the investment, data center operators would need to generate over $500 billion in net cash flow by 2028 just to cover equipment costs
• Meeting shareholder expectations would require consumers and businesses to pay approximately $3 trillion for AI services—equivalent to 10% of current US GDP or 5% of global labor costs
• Current AI revenues remain modest: OpenAI runs at $13 billion annually, with total application revenues estimated at just over $40 billion in 2025

Limited Profit Impact to Date

• MIT research found 95% of 300 publicly disclosed AI initiatives failed to deliver any profit boost
• McKinsey reported that 71% of companies use generative AI, but over 80% saw no tangible earnings impact
• Even with optimistic forecasts, a massive gap exists between projected revenues and the investment needed to justify current spending levels

Winner-Take-All Hopes May Be Misplaced

• Historical tech industry concentration over 25 years fuels investor patience for long-term payoffs, despite current losses
• Competition is increasing across all segments: new data center players like Oracle and Coreweave are emerging, and large language model entrants like Grok and DeepSeek are fragmenting the market
• Data centers are high fixed-cost, low marginal-cost businesses that tend toward competitive pricing when oversupply occurs—similar to airlines or telecom after the dot-com bust

Prisoner's Dilemma Driving Behavior

• Tech leaders face an "innovators dilemma": the risk of underinvesting and being left behind outweighs concerns about overinvestment, as stated by Alphabet's CEO
• Fear of cannibalization drives spending—Bill Gates noted that personal AI agents could collapse separate markets for search, shopping, and productivity into a single competitive space
• Executives like Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg have expressed willingness to risk massive capital losses rather than lose the AI race
