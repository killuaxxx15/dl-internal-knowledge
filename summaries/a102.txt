What Makes a Good Investment

• High barriers to entry are the most critical factor, not growth or novelty alone
• Sustainable competitive moats include irreplaceable physical assets (airports, toll roads), advanced intellectual property (aircraft engines), installed base advantages, network effects, strong brands, and customer switching costs
• Essential products/services matter more than recurring revenue streams - businesses must provide something indispensable rather than discretionary
• Pricing power above inflation is a key test of whether a company has a true moat, as it directly translates to profit growth

Investment Approach and Valuation

• Long-term holding period averages 8 years, taking a "private equity approach" to public markets
• Focus on intrinsic value growth over time rather than short-term multiples, as great companies compound value
• Concentration strategy with 10-15 holdings rather than diversification across hundreds of positions
• Use DCF models but emphasize conviction and pattern recognition alongside quantitative analysis

Industries to Avoid vs. Invest In

• Avoids banks (leverage, opacity, low earnings quality), airlines, auto industry, retail, traditional asset management, and most manufacturing due to competitive pressures
• Prefers infrastructure (airports, toll roads), rating agencies, aircraft engines, stock exchanges with natural monopolies, and mission-critical software with switching costs
• Estimates only about 200 companies globally are truly high-quality and investable
• Big Tech companies like Microsoft and Alphabet have incumbency advantages through bundling and network effects, though some face increasing competitive risks

Evolution from Activist to Long-term Owner

• Shifted from aggressive activism to constructive engagement, recognizing that hardcore activism often involves bad businesses
• Passive indexation has reduced shareholder power, making traditional activist campaigns more difficult
• Still engages when necessary to protect investments, but prefers owning great businesses that don't require activism
• Acts as an owner rather than trader, focusing on governance and long-term value creation

Investment Philosophy and Team Culture

• Small team of 7-8 investment professionals emphasizes trust, collegiality, and shared philosophy
• Uses intuition alongside analysis, defining it as "thinking without thinking" or advanced pattern recognition
• Independent thinking is crucial - willing to go against establishment consensus (as with Wirecard short)
• Fundamental analysis focused on understanding what companies actually do rather than trading on data points or macro trends

Philanthropy and Purpose

• Gives away over $500 million annually through foundation and direct giving, focusing on climate change and children's health in Africa/India
• Specific areas include contraception access ($10 per avoided pregnancy), severe acute malnutrition treatment ($40 to save a child's life), and trachoma surgery ($50 to prevent blindness)
• Climate work emphasizes infrastructure building, regulation advocacy, and technical assistance to governments in high-emission countries
• Views philanthropy as expression of soul's fundamental nature of service, distinguishing between personality-driven desires and deeper spiritual purpose

Spiritual Perspective on Business and Life

• Believes spiritual development is essential for solving world's problems, including climate change and poverty
• Distinguishes between personality (focused on possessions, power, money) and soul (focused on service and meaning)
• Developed philanthropic instincts early in career, giving away first major bonus without fully understanding the motivation
• Advocates for young people to pursue spiritual paths to find real purpose, meaning, and joy beyond material success
