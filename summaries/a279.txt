Stop Ruining My Perfectly Good Bear Market

The "Permabear" Label Explained

• Grantham rejects the permabear label, explaining it stems from investors' extremely short time horizons during extended bull markets
• When markets stay overvalued for 4-5 years, anyone pointing out high valuations appears perpetually negative, even if they're eventually proven correct
• The current bull market has kept prices in the top 5% of historical valuations since 2010, making 15 years of appearing bearish despite simply noting expensive markets
• Great bubbles don't form in six months but spend years climbing from high to very high valuations, as Japan did reaching 45-65 times earnings

Four Bull Markets in One Cycle

• The post-2009 bull market is unprecedented, morphing through four distinct phases rather than having one simple explanation
• Phase 1: Recovery bounce from 2008 financial crisis; Phase 2: Stock buyback era with shrinking floats making stocks unsinkable
• Phase 3: COVID-era stimulus with trillions flowing directly into bank accounts; Phase 4: Current AI capex boom driving valuations
• This extended multi-phase structure differs from historical bull markets that typically had single, clear explanatory narratives

Late-Stage Bubble Indicators

• A distinctive pattern emerges at the end of great bubbles: speculative stocks that surged dramatically begin declining while blue chips continue rising
• This occurred in 1929, 1972, 2000, and 2021, when investors rotate from "crap" to quality like Coca-Cola before the cliff
• In 2021, Cathie Wood's fund fell while the S&P marched upward, with QuantumScape peaking in December 2020 with a market cap exceeding GM despite zero revenue
• The pattern reflects investors thinking "the music's playing, I've got to keep dancing, but at least I'll dance off the cliff with Coca-Cola"

Monopoly Power and Quality Stock Performance

• Every industry has experienced increased concentration over the past 50 years, with antitrust enforcement essentially dormant
• Quality stocks (stable high returns, no debt) represent a workable definition of monopoly power—price setters with fat profits who don't need debt
• Historically, quality stocks should underperform like AAA bonds, but they've returned 0.5% more annually than the market for 100 years
• Companies like Amazon exemplify this trend, dominating retail, cloud computing, acquiring Whole Foods and MGM, expanding into pharmacy with limited antitrust resistance

Structural Economic Vulnerabilities

• The system's complexity creates multiple potential breaking points, including auto loan defaults among lower-income consumers in a "strong" economy
• Climate change has become economically significant in just the last two years, with cumulative damage exceeding 0.5% of global GDP
• Since 2000, approximately 25% of GDP growth has been spent preparing for or repairing climate damage rather than productive growth
• Growing inequality threatens the Henry Ford principle—if the bottom half can't afford products, major industries like automotive face existential challenges

Demographic Decline and Loss of Economic Dynamism

• China's workforce is declining faster than projected, with total population declining years ahead of forecasts; Japan's 20-year-old workforce is 50% below its 1948 peak
• South Korea, China, and even India are experiencing fertility rate collapses decades ahead of predictions, with India already at 1.9 versus the expected 2040 timeline
• Countries experiencing multi-decade population decline lose their "moxie"—growing up seeing nursery schools and grammar schools close dampens bullish sentiment
• Japan exemplifies this loss of dynamism: once terrifying competitors in the 1980s with superior quality and innovation, now merely competent and professional without the drive that made them dominant
