Ed Thorp and Claude Shannon

Claude Shannon’s Multidisciplinary Genius and Information Theory

• Claude Shannon founded Information Theory and the concept of the "bit," creating the scientific foundation for modern computers and digital media.
• Shannon possessed a playful, polymorphic genius, engaging in diverse interests like unicycles, juggling, and building chess machines while solving complex problems.
• His work on signal-to-noise ratios and cryptography during WWII deeply influenced his later approach to analyzing stock market patterns and earnings growth.
• Unlike typical academics, Shannon successfully applied his theoretical insights to practical investing, viewing the stock market through the lens of signal extraction and information theory.

Ed Thorp’s Mathematical Conquest of Casinos

• Ed Thorp, a physicist and mathematician, mathematically proved that games like roulette and blackjack could be beaten, contrary to popular belief.
• Thorp and Shannon collaborated to build the first wearable computer, a cigarette-pack-sized device used to predict roulette outcomes in Las Vegas.
• Thorp invented card counting and published his findings in the best-selling book Beat the Dealer, which forever changed the gambling industry.
• Despite being banned and physically threatened by casinos, Thorp successfully turned a $10,000 stake into significant profits using his systems before moving to Wall Street.

The Kelly Criterion and the Science of Betting

• The Kelly Criterion is a mathematical formula for capital allocation that maximizes wealth compounding while preventing the risk of total ruin.
• The system dictates that bets should be proportional to the gambler’s or investor's bankroll and their calculated edge, scaling down when losses occur.
• Successful investors like Buffett, Munger, and Thorp utilize this philosophy, believing that accepting any risk of losing everything is foolish, regardless of the potential upside.
• The formula emphasizes that without a mathematical edge, one should not bet at all, and that survival is the prerequisite for long-term success.

Applying Casino Mathematics to Wall Street Dominance

• Thorp applied his gambling insights to finance, launching the Princeton Newport hedge fund, which achieved a 15.1% compound annual return over 19 years compared to the S&P’s 8%.
• Claude Shannon achieved an even higher return of 28% over nearly 30 years, largely through a buy-and-hold strategy focused on companies like Teledyne.
• Thorp pioneered the use of computers for identifying pricing anomalies in warrants and options, outperforming mutual funds that relied on intuition.
• Both men demonstrated that precise mathematical models and risk management could generate consistent, above-average market returns over decades.

Debunking the Efficient Market Hypothesis

• Academics like Paul Samuelson championed the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), claiming it was impossible to consistently beat the market through skill.
• Thorp and Shannon disproved EMH through their verified, long-term track records, treating the market’s inefficiencies as problems to be solved with science.
• Events like the Black Monday crash of 1987, where the market lost 23% in a day, served as a severe test that discredited the idea of perfectly rational markets.
• While economists argued theoretically that edges didn't exist, practitioners like Thorp and Buffett exploited those edges to build massive fortunes.

The Dangers of Leverage and Ignoring Survival

• Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) collapsed because its founders, despite their academic accolades, ignored the Kelly Criterion and used excessive leverage.
• LTCM’s failure illustrated "gambler’s ruin," where betting more to recover losses leads to total destruction, a mistake Thorp and Shannon carefully avoided.
• Warren Buffett noted that smart people go broke by "mistaking leverage for genius," risking what they have and need for money they do not need.
• The ultimate lesson is that investors must account for "fat-tail" events and extreme probabilities, ensuring they can survive market catastrophes to compound wealth eventually.
