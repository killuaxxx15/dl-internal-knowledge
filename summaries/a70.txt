The Investment Firm That Can 'Do Anything' | Sixth Street CEO Alan Waxman

Goldman Sachs Special Situations Group Foundation

• Started at Goldman's Special Situations Group (SSG), described as the "Navy SEALs of finance" - a $25 billion principal investing business that was a substantial part of Goldman's net income
• The group had complete flexibility to invest across any asset class, geography, sector, or duration, with one key constraint: couldn't lose money
• Learned to "unitize risk and return" across different investments, constantly comparing relative risk units and return units to find the best opportunities
• Successfully avoided losses during the 2008 financial crisis by recognizing when risk-return dynamics became unfavorable in 2006-2007

Core Investment Philosophy: Multi-Strategy Approach

• Maintains 15-25 active investment themes at any time, with each theme having a shelf life of 12-36 months before becoming overcrowded
• Operates across 10 different investment platforms, allowing migration to the best risk-adjusted opportunities as markets change
• Processes 450-500 deals monthly, using a framework that evaluates business quality, capital structure position, and legal documentation
• Emphasizes "whiteboarding" with CEOs to create bespoke solutions rather than deploying standard products

Cultural Foundation and Team Building

• Adopted the San Antonio Spurs' principle of hiring people who are "over themselves" - emphasizing teamwork over individual ego
• Maintains strict cultural values: no politics, no BS, no egos, only nice people who authentically care about collaboration
• Never lost a partner in the firm's history, attributing retention to holistic compensation including culture, development opportunities, and meaningful work
• Implements rigorous personal business plans for every employee, aligned with the firm's five-year strategic plans

Notable Investment Examples

• Spotify (2016): Provided $1 billion convertible financing when competitive threats from Amazon/Apple created market uncertainty, bridging the company to its successful IPO
• Airbnb (COVID-2020): Invested $1 billion during the pandemic when travel stopped, betting on human desire for experiences and the company's fundamental business model
• Real Madrid/FC Barcelona: Created innovative stadium joint ventures, capitalizing on the trend of local sports brands becoming global through technology

Tau Structure and Capital Flexibility

• Created a unique $30+ billion "synthetic Goldman balance sheet" called Tau that sits above all investment platforms
• Allows the firm to keep individual fund sizes modest while maintaining ability to write billion-dollar+ checks across asset classes
• Provides maximum flexibility in duration (2-year to 10+ year investments), geography, and return profiles (10% to 30%+ returns)
• Enables the firm to be one of the few that can consistently deploy large-scale capital across multiple strategies

Risk Management and "Facing the Tiger"

• Emphasizes the importance of evaluating both explicit and implicit risks, not just nominal returns
• Developed a cultural principle of "facing the tiger together" - when problems arise, the team comes together rather than pointing fingers or running away
• Views economic cycles and market dislocations as opportunities for firms with strong defense and flexible capital
• Warns about current risks including AI-driven job displacement and the wealth channel's rapid adoption of private alternatives

Leadership and Development Philosophy

• Spends time maintaining culture and developing people rather than micromanaging individual investments, trusting experienced partners to lead
• Believes in the Stephen Plus model - experienced professionals taking time to develop younger talent through mentorship and answering questions
• Emphasizes "future self" thinking - investing heavily in skill development early in career to maximize time with family later
• Maintains the vision of being the "largest startup in the industry" while staying investor-first rather than becoming a deployment factory
