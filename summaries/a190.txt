Is social media dead? Why so many of us are switching off

Declining User Engagement and Screen Time

• A Global Web Index study surveyed 250,000 people across 50 countries, finding social media usage dropped 10% between 2022 and 2024, down to 2 hours 20 minutes daily.
• The heaviest users—teens and 20-somethings—are leading the decline, moving away from platforms they once dominated.
• Users are increasingly deactivating accounts and "digitally detoxing" as the negative impacts of unchecked screen time become more apparent.

The Shift from Social Connection to Commercial Content

• Social media platforms have transformed from networking tools into advertising machines, with users constantly being sold products by influencers.
• Instagram is particularly problematic, with algorithm-driven content feeding users repetitive videos based on single clicks rather than genuine social connections.
• Many users report their friends no longer post content, making platforms feel less social and more transactional.

Toxic Content and Platform Polarization

• X (formerly Twitter) has become extremely political and divisive, with platforms designed to stoke anger and engagement through controversial content.
• Anonymous accounts posting abhorrent content, particularly from right-wing extremists, operate largely unmoderated while mainstream news receives minimal engagement.
• Features like Ask FM historically enabled anonymous harassment, and current platforms continue to allow toxic behavior when users aren't required to verify their identities.

The "Enshittification" of Social Media Platforms

• Social media follows a three-stage decline: first attracting users, then extracting value from them, and finally declining as quality deteriorates.
• Historical giants like Bebo and MySpace demonstrate that no platform is permanent—once commerce overtakes connection, platforms become "insidious."
• TikTok Shop's introduction signals the platform may be heading toward the same commercial saturation that degraded Instagram and Facebook.

Impact on Mental Health and Self-Esteem

• Excessive scrolling—averaging 78 miles per year per user—correlates with poor sleep, memory issues, and deteriorating mental health.
• Young users particularly suffered self-esteem damage from features like Ask FM and the constant comparison with influencers and celebrities.
• The influencer culture created unrealistic standards, with teens attempting to replicate jet-setting lifestyles and celebrity aesthetics during their formative years.

The Uncertain Future of Social Media Giants

• Platforms with billions of users like Facebook (3 billion users) appear "too big to fail," yet the internet itself is less than 30 years old and fashions change rapidly.
• Companies may need to reinvent themselves by improving user experience, investing in content moderation, and reducing commercial saturation to win back skeptical users.
• Experts predict the social media landscape will look dramatically different in 10 years, potentially improving as platforms respond to user exodus by addressing current problems.
