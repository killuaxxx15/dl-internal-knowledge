A Truck Full of Money: Coding, Mania, Love, Genius: The Life of an American Entrepreneur

Living with Bipolar Disorder While Building Companies

• Paul English, co-founder of KAYAK (sold to Priceline for $1.8 billion), openly struggled with bipolar disorder for 30 years, experiencing both debilitating depression and hypomanic highs that made him feel "on fire" but also prone to poor decisions.
• He insisted the author "not make him look better than he is," revealing the reality that successful entrepreneurs are flawed humans who can achieve extraordinary success despite mental health challenges.
• His hypomania drove intense productivity and grandiosity, but also led to risky behaviors like excessive spending, drinking against medical advice, and going on/off medications impulsively.

KAYAK's Remarkable Business Model and Efficiency

• KAYAK operated as a travel search engine earning referral fees ($0.75 per flight, $2 per hotel) rather than booking directly, generating 1.2 billion searches in 2012 that produced $292 million in revenue and $65.8 million in profit.
• The company achieved nearly $1.5 million in revenue per employee with only 205 employees—one of the highest ratios among publicly traded companies, demonstrating extreme operational efficiency.
• Paul's share of the $1.8 billion sale was $120 million, with about half his team owning stock worth at least $1 million each, reflecting his philosophy of sharing wealth with those who helped build the company.

Early Entrepreneurial Traits and Authority Problems

• From seventh grade, Paul refused to do homework ("f*** you, I will never do homework") but was highly industrious outside school, running a profitable drug dealing operation that could have bought "several used cars" by eighth grade.
• He found refuge in programming because computers didn't argue back or ignore him—creating a "place where he was in charge, a refuge inside a refuge" away from the chaos of his large family.
• His hatred of traditional authority and "the stupid box" (TV) drove him toward technology where he could create rather than passively consume what others wanted him to see.

Negotiation Lessons from His Father

• Paul learned negotiation by watching his father buy air conditioners at yard sales, starting with jokes to throw sellers off balance, then immediately naming a "crazy" low price that became an anchor point.
• When selling Boston Light Software, he applied these lessons by asking for $40 million (versus his planned $20 million) for a 6-month-old company with just $50,000 in revenue, ultimately settling at $33.5 million.
• His father's reaction—nervously looking around and asking "Who negotiated for you?"—validated that Paul had mastered the yard sale technique at a massive scale.

The Internet as a Democratizing Force

• Paul embodied the "technological exception" where programming ability mattered more than social class, table manners, or family connections—you just had to belong to "Knuth's 2% born to program computers."
• The book connects to the broader theme that the Internet "massively broadened the possible space of careers" and serves as "a great democratizing equalizing force," allowing people to escape traditional hierarchies.
• Paul represented "an old American" ethos that "refuses to be encumbered by the past"—where consistency doesn't matter, only invention matters, and you don't have to do what you were doing six months ago.

Philosophy of Essentialism and Doing Less Better

• Paul installed tally clickers outside meeting rooms and interrupted large meetings, insisting "3 of the dozen people" were smart enough to solve problems in half the time, echoing Jeff Bezos's "two pizza team" rule.
• After KAYAK's sale made him an employee rather than a founder, his work hours dropped from full-time to just 3 hours per week—he simply couldn't engage when not in control.
• His approach aligned with "if it isn't a clear yes, it's a clear no"—focusing ruthlessly on essential things (coding, building companies, helping others) while rejecting everything else to craft a more productive and fulfilling life.
