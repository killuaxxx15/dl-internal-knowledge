Rebalancing and Reform featuring Indermit Gill - Betting on America

Global Growth Crisis and Development Stagnation

• Global growth is decelerating to its slowest rate since 2008, with developing countries seeing growth fall from 5.9% in the 2000s to 3.7% in the 2020s, creating what Gill calls a "development-free zone" for many poor countries.
• While aggregate statistics appear positive due to China's past performance and India's current growth, most developing countries - particularly in Africa and Latin America - are experiencing stagnation with near-zero per capita income growth.
• Three key factors explain declining growth: aging demographics in many regions, diminishing returns on investment leading to lower productivity growth, and the erosion of the Washington Consensus on market-led growth, macro stability, and free trade.

Structural Trade Imbalances and Need for Rebalancing

• Persistent trade imbalances became unsustainable, with China maintaining undervalued currency leading to under-consumption, while the U.S. over-consumed, and the U.S. provided market access at much lower tariff rates than it received from trading partners.
• International institutions (IMF, WTO, World Bank) failed to adequately address these imbalances - the IMF didn't call out currency manipulation, the WTO didn't update rules for countries like China that dominate global manufacturing, and the World Bank was a "cheerleader" for China's model without addressing service sector restrictions.
• The current rebalancing represents a bipartisan U.S. consensus that structural imbalances are no longer tolerable, driven by economic dislocation, pandemic impacts, and national security concerns regarding China.

Future Development Strategies and Export-Led Growth

• Traditional export-led manufacturing growth strategies are no longer viable for large economies like India or Africa due to market saturation - India cannot replicate China's manufacturing model, and Africa cannot replicate India's services model.
• Countries need to negotiate in good faith for more reciprocal market access rather than maintaining asymmetric tariff structures, while exploring new pathways like agricultural productivity improvements using new technologies.
• The shift toward economic security policy risks over-indexing on state intervention in productive activities, potentially undermining the "timeless and universal power of markets" that drive productivity growth.

Technology as Development Driver and U.S. Opportunity

• Emerging markets show high optimism but low preparedness for AI adoption, creating opportunities for U.S. technology exports as a pathway to trade rebalancing, though developing countries face complex choices between U.S. and Chinese technology stacks.
• The U.S. maintains advantages in AI development through three key factors: ability to attract big money with minimal government priming, superior business process innovation for bringing technologies to market, and tolerance for social mobility despite imperfect tax/transfer systems.
• Technology transfer isn't straightforward - example of Indian food delivery services shows AI can reduce costs but shifts payments from domestic college-educated workers to foreign IP holders, creating new forms of economic dependency.

Critical Minerals and Modern Resource Curse

• The focus on critical minerals for AI and energy transition creates both opportunities and risks, with concentration of processing in China driving diversification efforts by the U.S. and allies.
• The modern resource curse manifests when countries keep raw materials for domestic processing, inadvertently protecting low-productivity firms that would otherwise exit the market, as seen in Indonesia's nickel industry.
• Success with resource extraction depends on institutional strength - countries with good governance benefit from foreign investment while those with weak institutions suffer, highlighting the importance of continued investment in institutional development.

Economic Reform in the Age of Populism

• Populism represents a correction to elite failures in managing globalization's impacts, particularly when occurring in large economies like the U.S. where it changes global dynamics.
• Future economists must focus on making markets work for the common good, requiring active state involvement to maintain competition since "folks who have to compete want to end competition."
• Key priorities include addressing debt crises in poor countries, ensuring trade doesn't immiserize segments of society even in rich countries, and returning to fundamentals of macro stability while adapting the American economic template for a multipolar world.
