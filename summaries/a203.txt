India's ₹8 Trillion Bet: Is the Middle Class Paying the Price?

Middle-Class Income Pressure and Declining Real Wages

• Wage growth in India’s 50 largest companies has averaged only 3%, while inflation is ~6%, implying -3% real wage decline per year.
• Roughly 80–90% of new graduates are not getting jobs, resulting in oversupply and wage suppression.
• Weak job creation post-2022 and stagnant salaries have crushed disposable income.
• The combination of weak jobs, low wage growth, and higher taxes led to a sharp consumption slowdown.

How Heavy Taxation Funded India’s Capex Boom

• The Government expanded public capex by 34% annually (2021–2024), reaching ₹10 trillion in FY24.
• To fund this, income tax rose from 2.5% to 3.8% of GDP, and GST from 2.5% to 2.8% of GDP.
• Together, this extracted 1.6% of GDP from the middle class to finance the capex surge.
• Higher taxes plus weak income conditions severely restricted household spending.

Government’s 2025 Response: A Massive Consumption Stimulus

• Income tax cuts (zero tax for incomes below ₹12 lakh): ~₹1 trillion stimulus.
• GST rate reductions (Sept 2025): ~₹2 trillion stimulus.
• Ban on real-money gaming, redirecting ~₹0.7 trillion back to consumption.
• Anticipated crackdown on F&O trading + RBI’s 100-bps rate cuts add up to a total ₹6.3 trillion (1.8% of GDP) stimulus.

New Threat: Trump’s 50% Tariffs on Indian Exports

• U.S. tariffs (excluding electronics & pharma) severely hit labor-intensive exports.
• Textile hubs (Tirupur, Coimbatore) and carpet, leather, footwear, sports goods, gems & jewelry sectors face major collapse.
• Could trigger up to 20 million job losses if unresolved by Christmas.
• A U.S.–India trade agreement is critical to prevent large-scale unemployment.

Structural Job Disruption: Automation, AI, and the Gig Transition

• Job losses in IT, banking, media, and advertising are driven by rapid AI adoption, not economic slowdown.
• Companies increasingly replace workers with AI-generated ads, automation, and higher productivity tools.
• India is expected to shift toward a large gig-economy workforce over the next 2–3 years.
• This transition will keep consumption growth muted despite stimulus.

Household Debt, Low Savings, and Personal Finance Recommendations

• Excluding home loans, household debt has risen to 33–34% of income, among the highest globally.
• Survey data: 14% of households have zero emergency savings; 40–50% save less than 20% of income.
• India is at a 50-year low in net household savings, creating financial vulnerability.
• Individuals are urged to increase savings, adopt financial planning, avoid F&O speculation, and manage expenses prudently.
