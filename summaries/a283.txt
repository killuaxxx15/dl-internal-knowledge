Robert Friedland (Mining)

Robert Friedland's Criminal Past and Early Influence

• At age 19, Friedland was arrested for selling over 24,000 LSD tablets worth $125,000, receiving a two-year prison sentence as the principal leader of an interstate narcotics ring.
• The judge noted Friedland was "driven only by one motivation: the large sum of money" with no concern for consequences to others, establishing a pattern of profit-focused behavior.
• During college at Reed College, Friedland befriended Steve Jobs and became a significant influence on Jobs' development, though their friendship was temporary.

The Voisey's Bay Discovery and Extraordinary ROI

• Diamond Fields Resources accidentally discovered the largest nickel deposit in North American history at Voisey's Bay with an initial investment of less than $1 million.
• Within 16 months, the company grew from a dubious diamond play to the world's most sought-after mining company valued at over $4 billion.
• Friedland ultimately sold the discovery for $4.3 billion at $43.50 per share, with his 13% stake becoming worth nearly $600 million.

Master Negotiation Tactics and Psychological Warfare

• Friedland used theatrical intimidation techniques, including famously banging his shoe on a marble conference table like Khrushchev, declaring "We will bury you" to Inco negotiators.
• He maintained the charade of mining Voisey's Bay independently to preserve leverage, despite having no genuine interest in developing the mine himself.
• His strategy of playing bidders Inco and Falconbridge against each other drove the price from $3.5 billion to $4.3 billion, preventing them from forming a joint venture.

The Competitive Cost Advantage That Forced Inco's Hand

• Voisey's Bay would allow Falconbridge to reduce nickel production costs from $1.60 to $0.90 per pound, while Inco's costs would only drop from $1.75 to $1.45 per pound with a 25% stake.
• This $0.55 per pound cost advantage would make Falconbridge 33% more cost-efficient, threatening Inco's market dominance and ability to compete on pricing.
• The existential threat to Inco's position as the world's number one nickel producer forced them to bid $4.3 billion despite initial resistance.

Pattern of Promotional Genius Despite Ethical Questions

• Friedland described his approach as "Promoting a stock is like making a movie—you've got to have stars, props and a good script," showing his understanding of narrative-driven value creation.
• His earlier company Galactic Resources collapsed amid environmental disasters at a Colorado gold mine, labeled one of the worst environmental mining disasters by the EPA with criminal investigations.
• Despite a controversial reputation and being shunned by major investors after previous failures, Friedland's charisma and sales ability consistently won over skeptics.

Strategic Deception and the Gap Between Words and Actions

• Experienced negotiators at Inco recognized Friedland's lack of mine development progress didn't align with his claims of wanting to mine independently, revealing his true intention to sell.
• Falconbridge CEO Pickard mistakenly believed he had a "special relationship" with Friedland due to deferential treatment, not recognizing it was strategic manipulation during a $4 billion negotiation.
• When Falconbridge attempted to form a joint venture with Inco, Friedland immediately threatened lawsuits and millions in damages, demonstrating his aggressive response when leverage was threatened.
