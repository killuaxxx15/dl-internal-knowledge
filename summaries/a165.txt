Winning the Competition for Good Jobs and High-Value Industries

Why Industrial Composition Matters

• Not all industries are equally valuable; the type of industries a nation has significantly impacts economic strength, technological capability, and national security
• Major technologies like the internet and jet engines were developed by government for non-commercial purposes but became foundations for vast private sector profits
• The U.S. has nine of the world's top ten robotics academic programs but none of the top ten robot companies, showing a disconnect between research capability and commercial production

The "Picking Winners and Losers" Fallacy

• Industrial policy primarily involves selecting strategic technologies (robotics, fusion power, biotechnology) rather than choosing specific companies to receive support
• Identifying important future technologies is surprisingly uncontroversial through institutions like the President's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology
• Direct company selection is justified only in rare cases where critical national capabilities are at stake (such as Boeing or Intel), representing less than 1% of industrial policy decisions

The Scale-Up Crisis and Manufacturing Ecosystem

• Industries become entrenched through accumulated capabilities, supply chains, and workforce expertise—the U.S. lacks flat-panel TV production because it lost the underlying LCD industry
• Intel's decline resulted from finance-oriented management prioritizing profit margins over technological leadership, missing opportunities in GPUs and smartphone chips
• China excels at rapid scaling while the U.S. has become weak at this critical stage, despite exceptions like Tesla's successful but difficult production ramp-up

Policy Tools Beyond Tariffs

• An overvalued dollar (inflated by foreign capital inflows) makes U.S. exports uncompetitive and encourages excessive imports; moderate capital controls could reduce the dollar's value by 15-20%
• Comprehensive industrial policy requires multiple tools including tariffs, workforce development, regulatory modernization, and targeted government investment in high-risk or long-horizon technologies
• The Trump administration's Section 232 investigations on specific industries like robotics represent more sophisticated targeting of strategically important sectors beyond simple across-the-board tariffs

Learning from International Success and Failure

• Successful industrial policies (Japan, Korea, China, Germany) and failures (post-WWII Britain, Argentina, India) reveal that success depends on specific, comprehensible factors rather than mysterious or uncontrollable variables
• China's state capitalist model with aggressive intervention means the U.S. must have its own industrial policy to compete, though not necessarily copying China's approach
• The U.S. still has strong private sector capabilities and sophisticated capital markets, so policy should focus on creating the right environment rather than direct government investment in most cases

Current Policy Trajectory and Gaps

• The Biden administration's continuation and expansion of Trump-era tariffs, plus the Inflation Reduction Act, marked important progress but focused on non-economic rationales (national security, public health, environment)
• Critical missing elements include addressing the overvalued dollar through capital controls and expanding federal support for technology development based on economic value, not just defense or environmental goals
• Eliminating the de minimis exemption that allowed $100-150 billion in untariffed imports was essential groundwork, but more systematic approaches to strategic industries are needed
