Freedom's Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II

America's Unpreparedness in 1940

• In May 1940, the U.S. had the 18th largest army in the world (smaller than Argentina and Hungary), no defense industry, and only 1,500 aircraft total
• General George Marshall warned that if Hitler landed five divisions on the Atlantic coast, nothing could stop them from reaching the Rockies
• The defense industry had been dismantled after WWI due to "merchants of death" investigations; DuPont's munitions production had shrunk to 2% of revenues by 1940
• Roosevelt turned to Bill Knudsen, President of General Motors, who quit his job and came to Washington promising to mobilize industry in 18 months

The Bottom-Up Production Revolution

• Knudsen rejected top-down government control in favor of voluntary, free-market mobilization that leveraged existing supply chains and incentives
• By Pearl Harbor, U.S. war production approached Nazi Germany's; by end of 1942, it exceeded all Axis powers combined; by 1943, it surpassed Britain, Germany, and Japan combined
• Total production: 300,000 planes, 90,000 tanks, 2.5 million trucks, 8,800 naval vessels, and 41 billion rounds of ammunition
• The U.S. produced eight aircraft carriers per month by 1944

Innovation Through Private Industry

• Knudsen awarded contracts to America's most innovative companies, even those with no military production experience, trusting their engineering talent to solve problems
• Automobile companies like Chrysler and GM introduced crucial improvements: welding instead of riveting tank armor (making them safer and faster to produce)
• Aircraft companies proved highly innovative: North American Aviation designed the P-51 Mustang prototype in 99 days after telling the British their requested P-40 was "a crappy plane"
• Nearly every successful American aircraft in WWII was a pre-war design, waiting for production orders (only exception: Grumman F-6F Hellcat)

The New American Workforce

• Women became critical to production, comprising one-third of aircraft workers by 1943 and 70% of Kaiser shipyard workers by 1944
• Appalachian southerners migrated to new war plants built inland (away from coasts for security), transforming cities across the country
• African Americans found industrial jobs for the first time, completing the Great Migration and creating "the first serious cracks in the system of segregation"
• In 1942, Americans killed or injured in war-related industries exceeded those killed or wounded in uniform by a factor of 20 to one

Leadership and Sacrifice

• Bill Knudsen, a Danish immigrant who worked up from Ford's shop floor, left GM's presidency to serve when his president called, saying "I owe this country everything"
• Roosevelt fought against his own instincts and advisors' preferences for command economy controls, trusting Knudsen's voluntary approach
• At General Motors alone, 189 senior executives died on the job from heart attacks and work-related stress during the war
• Business leaders risked converting plants from profitable civilian production to war materials with no guarantee of recovery if the war was lost or prolonged

The Cost-Plus Contract Revolution

• Knudsen insisted on "cost-plus" contracts where government covered development costs plus a fixed fee, eliminating the risk that had prevented companies from innovation
• This enabled rapid prototyping and technological experimentation without fear of total financial loss from rejected designs
• The system unleashed technological innovation essential for modern warfare but became a permanent feature of the military-industrial complex with mixed long-term consequences
• American production also supplied one-fifth of Soviet GNP during the war and provided every fourth meal eaten by the British
