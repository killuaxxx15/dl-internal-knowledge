Edwin Land (Steve Jobs’s Hero)

Edwin Land's Philosophy of Concentration and Creative Work

• Land believed intense, uninterrupted concentration was his chief intellectual weapon, stating that interruptions during problem-solving could cost a year of work to recover what could be achieved in 60 hours of focused effort.
• He viewed scientific discovery as uncovering individual human potential rather than a group activity, rejecting the concept of collective creativity in favor of individual originality.
• Land optimized conditions for himself and associates by acknowledging the fragile nature of breakthrough moments, when "atavistic competencies seem to come welling up" during deep focus.

Creating Markets Through Innovation Rather Than Fitting Existing Ones

• Land consistently ignored expert predictions of failure because experts evaluated products only within existing market frameworks, while Land believed sufficiently ingenious products could create entirely new markets.
• He trusted his own instincts over conventional wisdom from the beginning, understanding that markets for revolutionary products don't exist until those products define them.
• This approach extended from the polarizing filter through the instant camera to the SX-70 system, each representing radical departures from previous thought and practice.

Business Philosophy: Purpose Over Profit

• Land operated on faith that doing excellent work would naturally produce financial success, stating "if you do your job well, the last thing you have to worry about is money, just as if you live right, you will be happy."
• He reframed corporate challenges as "high technological drama" rather than problems, viewing setbacks as opportunities even during Polaroid's biggest financial gamble on the SX-70.
• Land saw no separation between life philosophy and business strategy, viewing everything as interconnected—how you live, maintain happiness, build businesses, and do scientific work.

The Human and Social Dimension of Products

• Land described the SX-70 camera in unexpectedly poetic terms, believing it revealed "buried within us, a latent interest in each other" and enabled "tenderness, curiosity, excitement, affection" among people.
• He envisioned the camera achieving telephone-level ubiquity and impact, fundamentally changing how people live and relate to one another.
• His marketing materials read like philosophy, describing products as enabling "a prehistoric tribal competence for non-physical satisfaction in being partners in the lonely exploration of a once-empty planet."

Individual as Institution Builder

• Land embodied the Emerson principle that "an institution is the lengthened shadow of one man," with Polaroid's development inseparable from his singular vision and personality.
• He represented the last major technological visionary-entrepreneur in the tradition of Henry Ford and George Eastman, combining New England inventor heritage with contemporary American dream realization.
• Steve Jobs explicitly modeled his career after Land, calling meeting him "like visiting a shrine" and considering him a national treasure.

Focus on Unique Contributions Over Replication

• Land rejected the conventional business approach of simply scaling existing successful products, instead insisting companies focus exclusively on "things that only you can do that no one else can do."
• His mandate was to continually invent new things and bring novel products and services to market rather than perfecting production of existing offerings.
• This philosophy drove Polaroid's continuous innovation despite the conventional business wisdom favoring operational efficiency and market expansion of proven products.
