How Larry Ellison Thinks

Self-Criticism and Forward Focus

• Ellison spent years being embarrassed by his performance as CEO during Oracle's first 15 years, making him his own harshest critic.
• He has extraordinarily little interest in the recent past but reads voraciously about history, focusing instead on what's next rather than dwelling on achievements.
• He embodies Steve Jobs' philosophy: "If you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should just go do something else wonderful and not dwell on it for too long."

The Internet Revolution and Contrarian Thinking

• In the late 1990s, Ellison understood the Internet's potential earlier and more clearly than almost anyone, realizing it would exponentially expand rather than end the database market.
• He made the radical decision to abandon all client-server development and concentrate Oracle's entire engineering effort on Internet-based architecture, repeatedly stating "the Internet changes everything."
• He consistently acts on beliefs that few others share, forcing competitors to become followers by getting there first—similar to current AI transformation dynamics.

War on Complexity and Customer Experience

• Ellison views the creation of complexity as the "cardinal sin" of computing and constantly works to simplify decision-making for customers.
• He uses the analogy that Silicon Valley sells parts while customers want cars: "If Detroit ran like Silicon Valley, nobody would sell cars. They would just sell parts."
• His approach focuses on Oracle doing the work for customers rather than making them assemble disparate systems themselves.

Strategic Enemy Selection and Brand Building

• Ellison deliberately picked fights with Microsoft and IBM—"the biggest, most dangerous bully in the schoolyard"—to establish Oracle's position and improve competitiveness.
• His philosophy: "Be nice to the alligator and maybe he'll eat you last. Let's kill the fucking alligator before he kills us."
• The media-friendly rivalry with Bill Gates became "Billionaire A versus Billionaire B," generating massive press coverage and elevating Oracle's brand through constant comparison with industry giants.

Leadership Through Confidence and Authenticity

• Ellison operates as a "sprinter, not a grinder"—resting and sprinting in cycles rather than maintaining methodical, relentless grinding like Gates.
• He believes leaders cannot be filled with uncertainty, using the Marine officer analogy: confidence and competence inspire followership more than honest admission of doubts.
• He's unapologetically himself—unfiltered and refusing political correctness—though he admits "it took me a long time to understand that we all want to be loved—even me."

Purpose and Self-Discovery Through Challenge

• Ellison constantly raised the bar as he approached goals, using the software business as a high-stakes test for self-discovery and exploring personal limits.
• After achieving financial independence, he realized the critical challenge: "You've got to figure out what it is you really love to do, because there's no other justification for doing it."
• His ultimate measure: "If I found out I was dying and I had a year to live, I wouldn't change my life very much"—indicating alignment between his work and deepest values.
