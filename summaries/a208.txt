Andrew Carnegie

Default Optimism as a Life Strategy

• Carnegie believed a sunny disposition is worth more than fortune and can be deliberately cultivated like training the body
• The mind can be "moved from shade into sunshine" through conscious effort—optimism is a skill, not just personality
• Problems should be laughed away when possible, viewing challenges as opportunities rather than insurmountable obstacles
• This optimistic approach only works authentically when not stemming from personal wrongdoing or compromised integrity

The Judge Within: Personal Accountability

• Carnegie's "grand rule of life" was "Thine own reproach alone do fear"—the internal judge cannot be cheated
• External opinions are uncontrollable; what matters is being comfortable with your own self-assessment
• Self-reproach from knowing you're taking shortcuts or not giving your best effort is inescapable and deeply harmful
• Inner peace comes from knowing you're doing your best work with integrity, regardless of others' judgments

Focus Over Diversification in Business

• Carnegie rejected conventional wisdom about diversification, advocating instead to "put all good eggs in one basket and watch that basket"
• True preeminence comes from mastering one line of business rather than scattering resources across many ventures
• The best investment is in your own business, not distant enterprises or bank shares—the "true gold lies in their own factories"
• Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger echoed this philosophy 100 years later: diversification is for those who don't know what they're doing

Labor as Investment, Not Just Cost

• Carnegie believed higher wages for respected, happy employees yielded big dividends as a genuine investment
• Employee retention creates continuity and efficiencies of scale that outweigh short-term cost savings
• Treating talented people well is essential because they know their market value and will leave if undervalued
• Viewing labor costs the same as commodity costs (like vegetables) misses the dynamic, emotional nature of human workers

From Scottish Poverty to Steel Empire

• Carnegie rose from poverty as a Scottish immigrant boy to become America's great steel-master through trials and triumphs
• He built a colossal industry and amassed an enormous fortune, then systematically gave it all away
• His "gospel of wealth" established a precedent for how millionaires should distribute their fortunes for mankind's betterment
• His life story represents one of history's most remarkable transformations from poverty to industrial dominance to philanthropy

Attention as Precious Resource

• Carnegie emphasized the critical importance of guarding your attention and directing it to what truly matters
• Success requires concentrating whole time and attention on one business and putting every dollar of capital into it
• His decision to focus entirely on iron and steel manufacturing, becoming its master, was taken early and held throughout
• Scattered focus across multiple concerns prevents the mastery necessary for preeminent success
