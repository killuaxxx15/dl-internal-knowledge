The King of Oil: The Secret Lives of Marc Rich

Marc Rich's Revolutionary Business Innovation

• Created the spot market for oil in the 1970s, allowing crude oil to be freely traded based on supply and demand rather than fixed long-term contracts.
• Broke the cartel of "Big Oil" (the seven sisters) that had dominated the global oil trade since World War II, controlling everything from wells to gas pumps.
• Before Rich's innovation, only 5% of the world's oil was freely traded, while 95% changed hands through fixed-price long-term contracts.
• His pioneering work made him the "king of oil" and a foundational architect of modern commodities trading and globalization.

Rise from Refugee to Billionaire

• Came to America as a poor Jewish Holocaust survivor and built himself into one of the world's richest commodity traders through sheer determination.
• His career intersected with major historical events including Castro's revolution (1959), African decolonization (1960s), the 1974 oil shock, Iran's 1979 revolution, South African apartheid, and the Soviet Union's collapse.
• Built Marc Rich + Co. into the world's largest commodity trader, active in 128 countries with annual profits of $200-400 million.
• Created more millionaires in Switzerland than any other company by giving employees, even secretaries, share options—a stark contrast to his former employer who paid him only $100,000 despite generating $4-5 million annually.

The Downfall and Fugitive Status

• Fled the United States in 1983 to avoid charges of tax evasion and illegal oil deals with Iran during the hostage crisis.
• Despite his entrepreneurial achievements, his name became synonymous with scandal rather than business success or the American dream.
• Eluded U.S. agents for nearly 20 years, living as a fugitive while continuing to operate his global trading empire.
• Lost control over his reputation, his wife, and ultimately his company due to the legal troubles and personal pressures.

The Philosophy of Opportunistic Trading

• Viewed wars and revolutions not as curses but as business opportunities, positioning himself strategically during global crises.
• Operated with high stakes and high risks throughout his career, trading with controversial regimes and in unstable regions.
• His approach involved being present on the scene when major historical events unfolded, leveraging chaos for profit.
• The willingness to trade with anyone, anywhere, regardless of political considerations, became both his greatest strength and eventual liability.

The Zinc Market Disaster

• Lost $172 million in a failed attempt to manipulate the global zinc market in 1992, buying large quantities to artificially inflate prices.
• Ignored warnings from senior traders who told him it was artificial demand and the bubble would burst, violating his own hedging principles.
• The failure occurred during a period of personal turmoil—excessive drinking, family problems, and intense pressure that impaired his judgment.
• This catastrophic loss damaged his credibility severely and triggered a series of events leading to his forced departure from the company he founded.

Forced Exit and Legacy Erasure

• Was forced to sell his company in 1994 after weakened position following the zinc disaster and internal pressure from younger management.
• Sold Marc Rich + Co. for approximately $600 million (including performance payments), though its value was estimated at $1-1.5 billion—described by buyers as selling "cheap."
• The company was renamed Glencore, which remains the world's largest commodity trader and Switzerland's largest firm by revenue.
• His name was completely purged from the company's history, with no mention on Glencore's website despite his founding role and revolutionary contributions to global commodities trading.
