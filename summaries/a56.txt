The US Bombed Iran. Now What? | TED Explains the World with Ian Bremmer

Background and Context of the US Attack on Iran

• On June 21, 2025, the US bombed three nuclear sites in Iran, marking a significant escalation that plunged the world into uncertainty and joined the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict
• The attack specifically targeted Iran's nuclear capabilities, including the critical underground facility at Fordow, which is located 100 meters under rock and concrete beneath a mountain
• Iran had been ramping up uranium enrichment and stockpiling highly enriched uranium after Trump withdrew from the JCPOA nuclear deal, bringing them closer to potential nuclear weapons capability
• US and Israeli intelligence communities disagreed on how close Iran was to developing nuclear weapons, with Americans not convinced Iran was covertly working toward breakout capability
• Iran was not in compliance with international inspectors and was secreting parts of their nuclear program, creating the justification for military action

Israel's Role in Escalating the Conflict

• Israel initiated the war by attacking multiple Iranian military sites and assassinating key military leaders, including officials involved in US-Iran nuclear negotiations
• The Israelis lacked the capability to destroy the critical Fordow facility, as they didn't have B-2 bombers, trained pilots, or bunker-buster bombs necessary for the mission
• Israel specifically pushed the US to take military action against the underground nuclear facility that was beyond their own military capabilities
• Over 30 Iranian military leaders have been assassinated by Israel, leaving Iran with less experienced, more junior leadership in critical positions
• Israel continues to be in a state of war with Iran and wants the United States to maintain an ongoing state of war, not just one-time strikes

Trump's Decision-Making Process and Diplomatic Efforts

• Trump spent a week attempting final negotiations with Iran before ordering the attack, using special envoy Steve Witkoff for direct communications
• The Iranian government refused to accept voluntary dismantlement of their entire nuclear program with inspections, viewing this as too critical for regime legitimacy
• Trump publicly demanded Iranian surrender of their nuclear program, which Iran found unacceptable, leaving military action as the only alternative
• The Trump administration maintains this is not a regime change effort and hopes to compel Iran back to negotiations despite conducting acts of war
• Trump has experience with Iranian military actions from his first term, having ordered the assassination of Qasem Soleimani with limited Iranian retaliation

Trump-Netanyahu Relationship and US-Israel Alignment

• Trump's support for Israel has remained consistently strong, contrary to media speculation about growing distance between the two leaders
• During Trump's first presidency, he implemented the Abraham Accords, recognized Israeli sovereignty over Golan Heights, and moved the US Embassy to Jerusalem
• Netanyahu was the first foreign leader invited to meet Trump in the Oval Office after Liberation Day, demonstrating continued prioritization of the relationship
• While Trump and Netanyahu had contentious phone calls during the crisis, Trump never threatened to cut military aid or intelligence support to Israel
• The US provides Israel with billions in military support and critical intelligence processing capabilities that are essential for Israeli operations

Potential Iranian Response and Military Capabilities

• Iran's parliament approved measures to potentially close the Strait of Hormuz, though this is largely seen as rhetorical flourish rather than serious policy
• Closing the Strait of Hormuz would be essentially suicidal for Iran, as the US has more naval and air power in the Persian Gulf than at any time since the Iraq War
• More likely Iranian responses include attacks on US military assets through Shia militias in Iraq or Houthis in Yemen, rather than direct Iranian action
• Approximately 40,000 US service members in the region are within reach of Iranian ballistic missiles and proxy threats, making them vulnerable targets
• Iranian state media is portraying the US attacks as weak and causing only peripheral damage to maintain regime stability and popular support

Command Structure Concerns and Risk of Escalation

• Iran's 85-year-old Supreme Leader is hiding in a bunker without internet access, making military communication more challenging than usual
• The assassination of numerous experienced Iranian military leaders raises concerns about less experienced commanders potentially acting without central authorization
• There are significant risks of rogue Iranian military leaders ordering attacks that could dramatically escalate the conflict beyond central government control
• Trump has publicly stated that the US knows the Supreme Leader's location and could kill him if necessary, serving as a deterrent against major escalation
• The fog of war and deteriorating Iranian command structure increases the possibility of irrational or uncoordinated Iranian responses

Regional and International Reactions

• Unlike the Gaza conflict where Israel was globally isolated, European allies, Britain, Canada, and others support Israeli actions against Iran's nuclear program
• Only Finland among EU members condemned the Israeli attacks on Iran, with most other allies providing at least tacit support
• Gulf states privately welcome actions against Iranian military capabilities despite public opposition, as they don't want Iran to have nuclear weapons
• China, despite getting significant oil from Iran, is playing a minimal diplomatic role and offering little meaningful support to Iran
• Gulf states are concerned about potential threats to energy exports but are not committed friends of Iran and benefit from reduced Iranian capabilities

Russia's Limited Response and Strategic Calculations

• Russian attacks on Ukraine have intensified during the Iran crisis, taking advantage of diverted international attention from the Ukraine conflict
• Despite Iran being a key military supplier to Russia with drone factories and ammunition, Russia is providing minimal support to Iran during this crisis
• Putin maintains reasonable relationships with both Iran and Israel, including guarantees for Russian scientists working at Iranian nuclear sites
• Russia's failure to significantly support Iran demonstrates Tehran's isolation and lack of reliable international allies
• The Iranian leadership recognizes their global isolation, which serves as a restraining factor against major escalatory responses

Domestic US Political Dynamics and MAGA Base

• Core MAGA ideology emphasizes anti-war sentiment rooted in isolationist, "America First" thinking, creating potential tension with military action
• Trump's messaging to his base emphasizes that destroying Iran's nuclear capabilities aligns with MAGA principles and doesn't constitute betrayal
• MAGA supporters generally oppose prolonged ground wars but are more accepting of quick, decisive military strikes like the TikTok war model
• Trump risks losing base support if the conflict evolves into an extended "Israel First" rather than "America First" commitment
• Trump is currently 0 for 3 on his promise to end ongoing wars (Russia-Ukraine, Israel-Gaza, Israel-Iran), creating political pressure for quick resolution

NATO Summit and Alliance Dynamics

• The NATO summit in The Hague is expected to be more successful than recent G7 meetings, with major announcements about increased defense spending
• NATO allies will announce a 5% defense spending target (3.5% hard defense, 1.5% defense-related infrastructure), significantly higher than previous commitments
• Trump's approach to Ukraine has shifted from aid-based support to critical minerals deals, framing assistance as protecting US economic interests
• NATO members are generally more supportive of US-Israeli actions against Iran compared to their positions on Gaza operations
• The NATO relationship has significantly improved from its low point following earlier tensions over European relations and Ukraine policy

Economic and Strategic Implications

• Successful containment of the conflict depends on Iran not responding with major escalation and Israel not successfully dragging the US deeper into war
• Failed containment could lead to regional conflagration, oil prices over $120, and global recession
• Iran's energy export capabilities remain undamaged, giving them incentive to avoid actions that would invite destruction of these assets
• The conflict's trajectory will significantly impact global energy markets and economic stability, particularly if shipping through the Strait of Hormuz is disrupted
• Gulf states' economies could be deeply undermined if the war escalates beyond current containment levels, affecting global energy supplies
