The Biography of Herb Kelleher

Anti-Planning Philosophy and Adaptive Strategy

• Kelleher rejected traditional strategic planning because reality is chaotic while planning is rigid and ordered, believing written plans become "gospel" that stifles flexibility and creative thinking.
• He preferred immediate action over lengthy analysis, exemplified by his response to USAir's California exit: rather than spending months debating with officers and the board, he advocated for buying planes immediately and dominating the market.
• When questioned about Southwest's strategic plan by a financial analyst, his response was characteristically simple: "It's called doing things," emphasizing execution over documentation.

Focus and Simplification as Core Business Principles

• Both Kelleher and Steve Jobs shared an obsession with simplifying and focusing on what they do best, eliminating unnecessary options to achieve excellence in specific areas.
• This philosophy mirrors Vince Lombardi's Green Bay Packers success, where he built championship teams around perfecting one play (the power sweep) through relentless practice and execution.
• Excellence comes from closing the gap between the accidental and intentional, choosing "not just a something or even an everything, but a specific and well-chosen thing."

People-First Company Culture

• Southwest Airlines prioritized employees first, customers second, and shareholders third, believing happy employees naturally create satisfied customers and strong business results.
• Kelleher rejected "management by the numbers," arguing that humans are too complex to be reduced to data points and that great business is fundamentally about understanding people.
• The company maintained genuine care for employees as individuals, not just workers, creating loyalty and exceptional service that competitors couldn't replicate.

Relentless Persistence and Success Mindset

• Kelleher frequently emphasized that "success is never final" and must be earned repeatedly, or it disappears—a philosophy he called essential for sustained achievement.
• He demonstrated extreme commitment during Southwest's founding legal battles, working around the clock for years to defend the airline's right to exist against established competitors.
• His approach embodied the principle that extraordinary outcomes require extraordinary effort and unwavering determination in the face of obstacles.

Intellectual Curiosity and Lifelong Learning

• Kelleher was a voracious reader who regularly spent $400-500 on book-buying binges and deeply studied subjects to understand them thoroughly.
• He read a 300-page history of Richmond, Virginia before speaking there, impressing locals with his detailed knowledge of their city's historical significance.
• This intellectual curiosity wasn't for show but stemmed from genuine interest, demonstrating how unpredictable benefits arise from continuous learning and avoiding being boring to others.

Contrarian Hiring and Management Practices

• Southwest hired for attitude over skills, believing they could train technical abilities but not personality, character, or cultural fit.
• Kelleher rejected conventional business wisdom, refusing to follow industry norms simply because "that's how it's done," instead building a unique operational model.
• He maintained that the airline business is fundamentally about people, not planes, focusing management attention on human relationships rather than purely operational metrics.
