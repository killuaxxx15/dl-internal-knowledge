Estée Lauder

Relentless Focus and Dream Fulfillment

• Success requires staying laser-focused on your target without distraction, demanding perfection rather than settling for mediocrity
• Estée believed that potential is unlimited and that daring to act on dreams is essential, emphasizing intense work over comfortable serenity
• Her philosophy centered on building empires through unwavering determination and refusing to let anyone say you can't achieve your goals

Building Around Timeless Human Desires

• The beauty industry fulfills an ancient, unchanging human desire to enhance appearance—from Cleopatra to modern times
• Similar to Jeff Bezos's philosophy, Estée built her business around constants rather than trends, ensuring compounding benefits over decades
• She positioned herself as an authority on beauty, recognizing that love, wars, and empires have been built on appearance throughout history

Persistence Through Rejection and Strategic Media Leverage

• Breaking into Harrods took multiple years and repeated rejections, but she systematically built media coverage first to create demand
• She visited beauty editors repeatedly, offering demonstrations and samples, generating press that forced retailers to notice customer requests
• After initial placement in general toiletries, she continued pushing through media attention until securing prestigious counter space

Direct Customer Connection and Hands-On Selling

• Estée personally touched faces and demonstrated products, believing physical contact and personal service were irreplaceable sales tools
• She pioneered giving free samples and makeovers, creating direct relationships with customers rather than relying solely on advertising
• Her motto was "telephone, telegraph, tell a woman"—recognizing word-of-mouth power through personal demonstrations

Product Excellence and Premium Market Positioning

• Maintained extremely high standards inherited from her father—"things must be perfect to be acceptable"
• Deliberately chose top-tier distribution through prestige stores rather than drugstores, protecting brand positioning
• Innovated within established categories (like creating Youth-Dew perfume/bath oil hybrid) rather than inventing entirely new concepts

Core Business Principles: The "Lauderisms"

• Keep your brand image clear and consistent, focusing on what you do best without distraction into unrelated products
• Watch competition not to copy but to innovate and execute better versions of existing ideas
• Learn to say no to inferior products and opportunities that dilute focus, even when wanting to please everyone
• Trust your instincts over consensus—pondering others' judgments often leads down the wrong path
