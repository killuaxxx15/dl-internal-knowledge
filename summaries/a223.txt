Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, George Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World

The Dawn of the Electrical Age and Its Pioneers

• The narrative focuses on the late 19th-century race to master electricity, a "mysterious fluid" that promised to transform society by illuminating the night and reducing the burden of labor.
• J.P. Morgan played a critical role as an early financier and "influencer," with his home being the first private residence in New York City wired for electricity, despite early technical hazards like burning floors.
• The transition from gas lamps and candles to electric light was difficult, requiring homeowners to employ expert engineers to manage generators and switch lights off by 11:00 p.m.
• Jeff Bezos compares the growth of the internet to the early electrical industry, noting that the lightbulb was the "killer app" that drove the initial adoption of electrical infrastructure.

Thomas Edison’s Method, Ego, and Resistance to Change

• Edison was a "voracious" self-taught reader inspired by Michael Faraday, believing that the purpose of scientific discovery was to make it practically useful for humanity.
• Despite his genius, Edison’s "pride of authorship" and ego prevented him from accepting the superiority of Alternating Current (AC), leading him to stubbornly cling to his Direct Current (DC) system despite its distance limitations.
• Edison relied heavily on trial-and-error experimentation, a method Tesla criticized as inefficient compared to using theory and calculation to solve problems before building.
• Eventually, J.P. Morgan forced a merger that created General Electric, erasing Edison’s name from the company without even informing him, effectively ending the war of currents.

Nikola Tesla’s Visionary Genius and Financial Sacrifice

• Tesla possessed a unique ability to visualize complex inventions entirely in his mind, solving the problem of a brushless AC motor to "liberate" humanity from hard labor.
• Unlike Edison, Tesla was a "poet of science" whose ideas were often dismissed as impractical, yet he correctly predicted that AC would allow electricity to travel vast distances.
• To save the Westinghouse company from financial ruin during a credit crunch, Tesla tore up a contract worth an estimated $17.5 million in royalties, prioritizing the success of his AC system over personal wealth.
• Tesla died without the fortune many of his peers amassed, but his dream of electrifying the world with AC power was fully realized during his lifetime.

George Westinghouse’s Leadership and Resilience

• Westinghouse was a formidable industrialist who valued control and manufacturing over licensing, having learned from early experiences where his patents were expropriated by railroads.
• He believed a corporation could have a "soul," striving to pay living wages and viewing money primarily as stored energy to be used for further invention and service to humanity.
• During financial crises, Westinghouse demonstrated immense composure, telling panicked associates that bankruptcy was "not the biggest thing in the world" and simply part of the day's work.
• Tesla admired Westinghouse as the only man capable of battling the prejudice, money, and power arrayed against the AC system to make it a reality.

The War of the Currents and Strategic Public Relations

• Edison waged a "caustic" PR war against Westinghouse, writing an 84-page diatribe warning that AC was deadly and lobbying for its use in the first electric chair executions to tarnish its reputation.
• Westinghouse refused to "play the other fellow's game," realizing that Edison’s attacks provided free advertising and that the superior utility of AC would eventually win out.
• Despite Edison’s head start and smear tactics, Westinghouse’s AC system rapidly gained market share, with sales jumping from $150,000 to over $4 million in just four years.
• The "war" effectively ended when the industry consolidated, with AC becoming the standard for power distribution due to its ability to step voltages up and down for long-distance travel.

Lessons on Commitment and Adaptability for Entrepreneurs

• The transcript highlights the concept of "pigs vs. chickens" in business: to do something great, one must be fully committed (the pig) rather than just interested (the chicken), as Edison demonstrated by self-funding his factories.
• Entrepreneurs are encouraged to be like "wolves," capable of surviving and thriving anywhere they are dropped by identifying resources and adapting to the environment.
• Westinghouse’s career illustrates that there is no such thing as "good enough," as he constantly sought to improve existing technologies, from air brakes to electrical transformers.
• Critics often dismiss new ideas as impossible without understanding them, but successful inventors like Edison and Tesla ignored the "gentlemen of academia" to pursue their visions.
