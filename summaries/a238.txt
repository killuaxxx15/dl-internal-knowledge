Henry Singleton (The Outsiders)

A Scientist’s Unconventional Path to Business Greatness

• Trained as a scientist with a doctorate from MIT rather than an MBA, Singleton did not found Teledyne until he was 43 years old after working at General Electric and Hughes Aircraft.
• Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger consider Singleton to have the best operating and capital deployment record in American business history, with returns described as "utterly ridiculous".
• Known as "The Sphinx," Singleton avoided publicity, refused to provide quarterly guidance to analysts, and ignored conventional business wisdom throughout his career.

Capital Allocation as the CEO’s Primary Role

• Singleton viewed himself primarily as an investor and capital allocator rather than an operator, a trait he shared with Warren Buffett.
• He used Teledyne's high stock price in the 1960s to acquire 130 profitable companies, then abruptly ceased all acquisitions when the stock's P/E ratio dropped.
• Demonstrating incredible market timing, he aggressively repurchased 90% of Teledyne’s outstanding shares when they were undervalued, generating a 42% compound annual return across the tenders.

Extreme Decentralization and Operational Efficiency

• Teledyne maintained a tiny corporate headquarters with fewer than 50 employees for a company of 40,000, avoiding layers of bureaucracy and departments like human resources.
• The company was split into 129 small profit centers, ensuring that failure in one unit would not jeopardize the entire company and allowing problems to be easily identified.
• Singleton delegated operations to George Roberts, allowing himself to focus almost exclusively on high-level strategy and capital allocation.

Prioritizing Cash Flow Over Reported Earnings

• Singleton and Roberts created a unique metric called "Teledyne Return," which averaged cash flow and net income to determine bonuses, emphasizing actual cash generation over accounting profits.
• Teledyne refused to pay a dividend for its first 26 years, arguing that the company could reinvest the capital at a higher rate (30%+) than shareholders could achieve on their own.
• The company prioritized high margins over revenue growth, willing to shrink the business or exit markets—such as the TV manufacturing industry—if they could not generate acceptable returns.

Contrarian Investment and Portfolio Management

• Singleton concentrated investments heavily in companies he knew well, at one point putting over 25% of Teledyne's equity portfolio into a single stock, Litton Industries.
• He ignored diversification dogma, shifting insurance subsidiary portfolios from 10% to 77% equities during bear markets to capture value.
• His approach was consistently anti-cyclical: he bought companies when prices were low, bought back his own stock when it was cheap, and spun off companies when the market valued deconglomeration.

Flexibility and Independent Thinking in Management

• Singleton refused to have rigid long-term plans, preferring to "steer the boat each day" and remain flexible enough to adapt to changing external environments.
• He fundamentally believed that if everyone else was doing something, such as share buybacks in the late 90s, there must be something wrong with it.
• This flexibility allowed him to seamlessly transition through different phases: from aggressive acquirer to aggressive share repurchaser, and finally to spin-offs and dividend payer when conditions warranted.
