PETER LEWIS' MONEY TALK - Tuesday 27 May 2025

Trump Administration Trade Policy and EU Relations

• Trump delayed 50% tariffs on the European Union until July 9th after receiving a call from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen requesting an extension, providing temporary relief from threats that were set to take effect June 1st.
• The EU represents the US's biggest trading partner with $320 billion worth of trade at stake, making this negotiation particularly significant for global economic stability.
• Trump is demanding that Europeans open their markets, change their consumption tax systems, and lower digital regulations, while maintaining his 10% baseline tariff on all imports - demands the EU considers largely impossible to meet.
• Experts believe the direct phone call between Trump and von der Leyen is significant and could lead to progress, as it bypassed lower-level negotiations that weren't advancing.
• The uncertainty created by tariff threats is causing more damage than the actual tariff levels, with companies delaying major investment decisions due to unpredictable policy changes.

China's Strategic Response and Economic Planning

• China is developing a new master plan to boost production of high-end technological goods, prioritizing chip-making equipment as an updated iteration of Xi Jinping's "Made in China 2025" campaign.
• Chinese companies are shifting focus toward the EU market, with BYD selling more cars in the EU than Tesla for the first time ever, though the biggest growth opportunities remain in the global south.
• China is preparing its next five-year plan to be announced by March 2026, demonstrating long-term strategic thinking that contrasts with Trump's day-to-day policy approach.
• Chinese markets are experiencing intense domestic competition, with companies like BYD cutting prices by up to 35% on 22 electric and plug-in hybrid models, leading to concerns about a new price war.
• China's approach to trade negotiations has proven effective, as they held firm against Trump's initial threats and got him to back down without making significant concessions.

US-Japan Economic Partnership Developments

• SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son has proposed a US-Japan sovereign wealth fund requiring approximately $300 billion in initial capital with significant leverage to invest in technology and infrastructure across the United States.
• The Nippon Steel-US Steel deal has evolved from Trump's initial opposition to a blocked takeover into what appears to be an acceptable partnership arrangement, representing a significant policy U-turn.
• The sovereign wealth fund idea has been discussed at high political levels in Washington and Tokyo, including conversations between Son and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent as both sides work toward a trade deal.
• This model of joint investment funds could serve as a template for other countries seeking favorable trade relationships with the Trump administration.
• Japan is showing more resistance to rushing into trade deals, learning from China's example and seeking agreements that benefit its own economy, particularly regarding auto tariff removal.

Corporate Pushback Against Trump Policies

• Apple is publicly stating it cannot build iPhones in the US, calling such demands "totally inconceivable" and insisting it must continue with existing plans in China and India that represent years of strategic investment.
• NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has declared US chip curbs on China a failure, noting they're cutting the company out of a $50 billion market while China develops its own competitive chips rapidly.
• Major US corporations are educating Trump about global economic realities, with tech leaders trying to explain why complete supply chain restructuring is neither feasible nor economical.
• Companies are demonstrating they won't simply follow Trump's directives if pushed too far, as these are global companies requiring access to foreign markets for survival.
• The pushback represents a significant challenge to Trump's command economy approach, as these companies have substantial political and economic influence.

Global Investment Strategy Shifts

• Investors are increasingly viewing the US as a major source of uncertainty rather than stability, leading to portfolio rebalancing away from excessive US exposure.
• Emerging and frontier markets are becoming more attractive investment destinations due to their domestic growth drivers that are less dependent on US trade and global export patterns.
• The combination of "gambling and gaming culture" is replacing traditional fundamental analysis in stock markets, with retail investors reacting to news rather than institutional investors examining valuations.
• Investment managers are conducting resilience checks on portfolios, specifically examining direct and indirect exposure to US markets through third-party export relationships.
• Gold and cryptocurrencies are rallying simultaneously (unusual behavior) as investors seek alternatives to US dollar assets, though no sufficient alternatives exist at scale.

Market Reactions and Financial Implications

• Stock markets are showing reduced sensitivity to Trump's policy announcements as both active investors and algorithms have adapted to the pattern of threats followed by backing down.
• US Treasury yields have surged dramatically, with 30-year rates back over 5% (highest since October 2023) and 10-year yields jumping from 3.9% to over 4.6% in just days.
• The US dollar index declined to 98.99, hitting its weakest level since December 2023, while Asia-Pacific currencies rallied as the greenback extended declines.
• Gold dropped below $3,350 per ounce after Trump delayed EU tariffs, while Bitcoin rebounded to trade at $109,440 after hitting a record high above $111,000.
• Chinese markets declined as investors await fresh stimulus measures, with the CSI 300 index down 0.6% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng falling 1.4%.

Long-term Economic Transformation Concerns

• There are growing fears that the US economy is shifting from a market-oriented system to a command economy where Trump determines investment locations, product sourcing, and manufacturing decisions.
• The prolonged period of uncertainty may continue throughout Trump's entire term, as he appears to enjoy the power and media attention that comes with market manipulation.
• Countries and companies are struggling with complete paralysis in decision-making, particularly for sectors requiring heavy investments and long development cycles.
• The lack of a five-day plan, let alone a five-year plan, from the Trump administration contrasts sharply with other major economies' long-term strategic approaches.
• The pattern of threats, negotiations, and backing down has become established, but the unpredictability continues to damage real economic activity despite market adaptation.

Alternative Reserve Currency Discussions

• ECB President Christine Lagarde suggested Trump's erratic policies create opportunities to strengthen the euro's international role as a reserve currency with lower borrowing costs and sanctions protection.
• Central banks and investors are divided between those believing the US dollar remains dominant and those seeking alternatives due to eroding confidence in American fiscal management.
• Japan's 30-year bond yields have risen 100 basis points in a month to 3.2%, making Japanese assets attractive for repatriation by domestic pension funds and insurance companies.
• The realignment of global trade is flowing into capital allocation decisions, with different countries developing divergent inflation, fiscal, and monetary policies rather than following Fed-led synchronization.
• Despite growing concerns, practical alternatives to the US dollar remain limited due to insufficient scale in gold and cryptocurrency markets and restrictions on renminbi convertibility.
