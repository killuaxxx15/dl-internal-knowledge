Larry Ellison (Oracle)

Ellison's Elusive Personality and Self-Mythology

• Larry Ellison is compared to Citizen Kane—a larger-than-life figure who believes in nothing except himself, maintaining tight control over his public image and rarely revealing authentic personal details.
• He is notoriously difficult to pin down, with some calling him a pathological liar while others say he simply exaggerates; the authenticity of his stories is often impossible to verify.
• Despite enormous success (becoming the fifth wealthiest person in the US), Ellison describes his achievements as "surreal" and dreamlike, something he neither anticipated nor fully believes even now.

Oracle's Revolutionary Database Technology

• In the mid-1970s, existing databases could manage customer accounts but couldn't answer unanticipated business questions quickly—like product sales by region or employee demographics.
• Ellison identified this critical gap and built Oracle's relational database software to answer complex, ad-hoc queries rapidly, giving businesses unprecedented decision-making capabilities.
• This technological breakthrough became Oracle's core competitive advantage and the foundation for the company's massive growth.

Obsessive Control and Equity Protection

• Ellison started Oracle specifically to be his own boss and maintained iron-fisted control throughout, always holding enough stock that his authority could never be challenged.
• He adamantly refused to raise venture capital or sell equity, preferring debt financing or organic growth through sales even during financial crises.
• This extreme confidence in himself meant he believed the company might fail, but he personally would not—he would simply move to the next opportunity.

Operational Chaos and the Henley Turnaround

• Oracle's early operations lacked basic common sense: they recognized all maintenance revenue upfront, had no bad debt reserves, and gave customers a full year to pay for software.
• Sales teams made fake deals with massive discounts and year-long payment terms to earn immediate commissions, creating phantom revenue that later required years of financial restatements.
• Jeff Henley was brought in against Larry's initial wishes and implemented revolutionary (but actually just sensible) changes: 30-day payment terms, proper revenue recognition, and adequate cash reserves.

The Steve Jobs Friendship—Competition's One Exception

• Larry is intensely competitive with everyone except Steve Jobs, whom he genuinely admired and called "the Edison of our time" and his only real friend.
• At the Toy Story premiere, Ellison experienced a rare non-competitive emotion—pure pride and happiness for Jobs' success, as if he had achieved it himself.
• Larry likely envied Jobs' career because while Oracle made him wealthier, Jobs created visible, beloved products that earned public adulation, unlike Oracle's hidden enterprise software.

Philosophy on Happiness, Love, and Work

• Ellison believes life's purpose is the enlightened pursuit of happiness through only two essential elements: love and work, "not necessarily in that order."
• Work matters because it's active creation and self-identification—he looks at Oracle and thinks "this is me"—but people you love are essential for sanity.
• His core advice: humans are builders who must find something they want to create and build it; getting good at both work and love puts you in "really great shape."
