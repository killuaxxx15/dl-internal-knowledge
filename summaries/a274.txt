Charles Kettering (inventor, engineer, founder)

Revolutionary Mindset: Embracing the Unknown

• Kettering insisted on approaching work as a "professional amateur"—professional because he knew challenges would arise, amateur because he treated everything as if doing it for the first time
• He maintained that humanity doesn't know even "a millionth of 1%" about anything, including how automobiles actually work despite mass-producing them
• This philosophy of intellectual humility drove him to question fundamental assumptions and pursue genuine understanding rather than accepting superficial explanations
• His wife joked she'd carve "I don't know" on his tombstone because he constantly emphasized the limits of human knowledge

Transformative Inventions and Business Impact

• Kettering held 186 patents and founded Delco, serving as head of research at General Motors from 1920-1947
• His major innovations included the electrical starter, leaded gasoline, Freon refrigeration, the world's first aerial missile, and lightweight two-stroke diesel engines that revolutionized locomotives
• Alfred Sloan, Billy Durant, Walter Chrysler, and Henry Leland all regarded him as a genius who created ideas, built industries, and inspired others to greater accomplishments
• His work exemplified how unusual individuals who break loose independently advance civilization far more than conventional thinkers

Competitive Strategy: Let Them Think You're Crazy

• Kettering deliberately allowed competitors to believe his ideas were foolish, particularly with diesel locomotive development
• By the time competitors realized the viability of his innovations, Kettering had solved the technical challenges and established market dominance
• This strategy prevented competitive interference during critical development phases when bugs were being worked out
• Competitors who eventually entered the field made "hasty ill-prepared entries" and struggled to catch up

Research Philosophy: Intelligent Failure

• Kettering taught that education paradoxically makes people worse inventors because schools punish failure, while invention requires failing hundreds or thousands of times before succeeding once
• He advocated "failing intelligently"—analyzing each failure to understand why it occurred, making each failure a step toward success
• He opposed centralizing research efforts, arguing that duplication in research is valuable because what groups do differently, not alike, produces breakthroughs
• His laboratory maintained a philosophy of always having everything to learn, never settling into complacency about existing knowledge

Rejecting Comfort: The Discipline of Struggle

• Kettering believed seeking comfort and rest was antithetical to progress—"there are no park benches" except at the undertaker's office
• He emphasized that difficulty and struggle strengthen people, warning that parents who make things easy for children deny them necessary discipline
• His philosophy held that choosing pioneer troubles over trailer troubles was the better path, requiring spunk and persistence despite opposition and repeated failures
• He maintained that profit requires progress, and progress requires constant change rather than finding ways for things to take care of themselves

Optimistic Vision: The Unexplored Continent

• Kettering rejected the notion that human progress had reached its end, arguing humanity had only reached the shores of a vast unexplored continent
• He believed you cannot plan new industries because breakthroughs emerge unpredictably—the automobile industry "grew in spite of planning"
• His view was that economic planning resembles betting on the Kentucky Derby—likely to pick the wrong horse
• He saw humanity's destiny as pondering existence and creating new life on earth, emphasizing we're at the very beginning of progress, not its conclusion
