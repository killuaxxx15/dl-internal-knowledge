Senator Ron Johnson on the Senate showdown over Trump's Big Beautiful Bill | All-In Interview

Senator Johnson's Background and Philosophy

• Ron Johnson was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2010 during the Tea Party movement, running on the platform "this is a fight for freedom, we're mortgaging our children's future"
• He identifies more as Tea Party than Republican Party, emphasizing that many Republicans are also "big spenders"
• Johnson comes from a private sector manufacturing background and would rather return to private life than serve in dysfunction
• He cannot be pressured by President Trump or political forces, stating he'd rather go home than compromise on fiscal responsibility
• His core belief is that power corrupts, government is power, and it has been corrupting over time

Understanding Budget Reconciliation Process

• Budget reconciliation was established in the Budget Act of 1974 but doesn't work for controlling spending
• It allows passage of budget measures with just 50-51 votes, avoiding the Senate filibuster
• Reconciliation can only address mandatory spending (75% of budget), not discretionary spending (25% of budget)
• The system has been "deviously" manipulated by moving discretionary spending into mandatory categories to avoid oversight
• "Other mandatory" spending exploded from $642 billion in 2019 to $1.3 trillion last year, projected to exceed $1 trillion annually going forward

The Fiscal Crisis: Alarming Numbers

• Current federal spending has increased from $4.4 trillion in 2019 to approximately $7.3 trillion projected for next year
• CBO projects an additional $22 trillion in deficit spending over the next 10 years, averaging $2.2 trillion annually
• Total debt could reach $62-63 trillion by 2035, not the more optimistic $59 trillion projection
• If interest rates rise to historical average of 5.8% (currently around 3%), this could add another $5 trillion in interest costs
• The dollar held in 2019 is now worth only 80 cents; a dollar from 1998 is worth only 51 cents today

Johnson's Opposition to Current Reconciliation Bill

• The House bill focuses on $1.5 trillion in savings over 10 years, which Johnson calls "meaningless" and "a rounding error"
• Johnson's goal is to reduce spending to $6.5 trillion in 2026 (pre-pandemic levels), requiring $800 billion in deficit reduction
• He believes the first goal should be "don't add to the deficit" and commits to returning to reasonable pre-pandemic spending levels
• Johnson argues that continuing to fund government at Biden's levels means failing to "defeat the deep state" as Trump promised
• He warns that the conservative base will ask "why did we elect you guys? You're really no better than Democrats"

The Spending Control Problem

• America has never had an effective process to control federal spending, unlike states with balanced budget requirements
• Previous attempts have failed: Simpson-Bowles, Budget Control Act, and other measures didn't work
• Congress spends less time reviewing the entire federal budget than private businesses spend on their own budgets
• Most members of Congress don't know total federal spending amounts and never discuss the full scope of the problem
• There's no public pressure to reduce spending because people love tax cuts and "free money"

Johnson's Proposed Solutions

• Advocates for a multi-step approach: border funding, extend current tax law, increase debt ceiling for one year to maintain pressure
• Proposes line-by-line forensic audit of all federal spending using thousands of budget lines
• Wants to establish a budget review panel with senators, House members, and administration officials
• Suggests comparing current spending to Clinton, Obama, and Trump pre-pandemic levels plus inflation and population growth
• Recommends taking the DOGE team and 100-200 forensic auditors to scrutinize spending systematically

DOGE's Role and Limitations

• DOGE has been valuable for exposing waste, fraud, and abuse, embarrassing Congress for their ignorance of spending problems
• However, DOGE's identified savings must be codified through rescission packages or reconciliation to actually bank the savings
• Johnson tried to work with Elon Musk to connect identified waste to specific appropriation accounts but didn't get sufficient response
• OMB finally sent a $9 billion rescission package, but DOGE's website shows much higher potential savings
• Previous rescission efforts failed: Trump's $15 billion package in his first term was voted down by Republican senators

Tax Policy and Economic Growth Concerns

• Johnson supports "no tax on tips" but questions "no tax on overtime," citing his manufacturing experience with shift work
• He believes current tax cut proposals won't generate significant economic growth, just reduce revenue
• Johnson prefers simplifying the tax code rather than adding complexity through targeted exemptions
• He supports closing the carried interest loophole, noting beneficiaries can't explain why it shouldn't be ordinary income
• Emphasizes that economic growth must come from private sector, not government deficit spending

Energy and Climate Policy

• Johnson thinks shutting down coal-fired power generation is "insane" given energy needs
• He supports nuclear power as the best option for those concerned about climate change (though he's not personally concerned)
• Opposes subsidizing energy production, preferring simple and rational tax policies
• Notes that 81% of incremental energy generation is backed by tax credits, creating market distortions
• Believes government misallocates capital through green energy policies, citing Europe and Germany as examples

Political and Electoral Concerns

• Johnson fears MAGA movement is too tied to one individual (Trump) unlike Tea Party's vision-based approach
• Worries about Democrats' effectiveness through media, social media companies, and voter fraud
• Notes concerning voting patterns: liberal Supreme Court candidate got 78% of Kamala Harris voters while conservative got only 62% of Trump voters
• Believes America may have passed the "hinge point" where majority realizes they can vote themselves benefits
• Estimates roughly 50% of Americans now work for government or government contractors, creating unsustainable voting dynamics

The Debt Death Spiral

• Describes how rising interest rates and deficits create a self-reinforcing cycle of increasing debt and higher borrowing costs
• Government borrowing crowds out private sector access to capital, limiting economic growth
• While America has vast wealth and won't go bankrupt, the risk is massive inflation wiping out savings and making life unaffordable
• Credit default swap markets are signaling increasing risk to private industry, which historically precedes government debt repricing
• Johnson emphasizes this is "our one opportunity" and warns against "blowing it" by maintaining status quo spending

Presidential Leadership Requirements

• Johnson has shown Trump his charts and graphs, with Trump expressing interest but not taking action to present them to the House
• Believes Trump has been too busy with other priorities to focus on spending reduction
• States Trump must acknowledge the numbers and work on a reasonable plan forward to earn Johnson's support
• Johnson plans to force the spending debate into public view through media appearances and continued pressure
• Emphasizes that defeating the deep state requires reducing its funding, not maintaining Biden-level spending
