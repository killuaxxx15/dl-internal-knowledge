Ray Dalio: Principles: Life and Work

Think for Yourself and Establish Clear Principles

• Principles are fundamental truths that serve as foundations for behavior and help achieve goals by providing repeatable frameworks for decision-making
• Most successful outcomes come from knowing how to deal with not knowing, rather than from existing knowledge itself
• Writing down and systematizing principles allows for better, faster decisions by classifying situations into types rather than treating each as unique
• Discovering and matching your own nature to your life choices is key to happiness, rather than following others' definitions of success

Learn from Painful Mistakes and Embrace Radical Truth

• Pain plus reflection equals progress—every mistake should be examined to extract principles that prevent future similar errors
• Creating an "idea meritocracy" where the best ideas win requires radical truth and radical transparency in organizations
• Ego and blind spots are the greatest barriers to learning; understanding how your brain works helps overcome these limitations
• Believability-weighted decision-making ensures ideas are evaluated based on track records rather than hierarchy or politics

Systematize Decision-Making for Better Results

• Converting investment criteria and principles into algorithms removed emotion and improved performance dramatically
• Bridgewater's system generated 45% returns in 2010 by processing information through programmed principles rather than relying on human judgment alone
• Having multiple uncorrelated return streams (approximately 1,000) combined systematically proved more effective than selecting individual good investments
• Over 26 years, this systematized approach made money in 23 years, outperforming all other hedge funds in total client returns

Meaningful Work and Relationships Trump Material Wealth

• The incremental benefits of extreme wealth fall off quickly—basics like good relationships, food, and rest matter most
• Being publicly successful and well-known often creates more burdens than benefits, limiting personal freedom
• Having billions versus millions doesn't significantly improve life quality beyond a moderate threshold
• People at the top aren't necessarily more special than those at other levels; discovering your own nature matters more than climbing hierarchies
