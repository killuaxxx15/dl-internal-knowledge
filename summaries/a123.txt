America’s Greatest Threat to Democracy Comes From Within

U.S. Russia Policy Failures (2000s-2020s)

• Every U.S. administration has failed to effectively counter Putin's growing aggression and appetite for destruction
• The Obama administration's "reset" policy with Russia ultimately failed, though Sullivan claims he warned of Putin's dark trajectory in 2012
• Trump consistently gave Putin a pass while taking tough action against allies and competitors, including refusing to impose tariffs on Russia
• Biden administration recognized invasion threat by fall 2021 but was unable to deter Putin despite laying out consequences

Ukraine War Strategy and Weapons Supply

• Sullivan defends the administration's weapons supply timeline, claiming they moved rapidly to provide massive military equipment at unprecedented scale
• Specific weapons like Abrams tanks and F-16s were delayed due to military assessments of limited battlefield effectiveness
• Nuclear threat considerations influenced decisions, with intelligence suggesting "coin flip" chance of tactical nuclear use if Russian lines collapsed catastrophically
• Economic sanctions on Russian oil were balanced against domestic gas price concerns to maintain American public support for Ukraine aid

American Isolationism vs. Global Leadership

• Sullivan distinguishes between harmful isolationism and principled foreign policy that avoids extended military entanglements
• China's authoritarian alliance building is partly a response to Biden's success in rallying NATO, adding Finland/Sweden, and linking European-Asian democracies
• Trump's approach has undermined these alliance gains, potentially doing China's work by weakening Western unity
• Future strategy should focus on investing in domestic strength, rebuilding alliances, and leading collective action on global challenges

Domestic Threats to Democracy

• Sullivan agrees that America's greatest security threat comes from within, specifically attacks on rule of law and democratic institutions
• Concerns about 2026 midterm elections potentially being compromised through FBI/DOJ manipulation
• Democratic Party's preparedness to counter authoritarian threats remains uncertain, requiring broader coalition beyond just Democrats
• Essential need for Republicans to establish clear lines they won't cross in supporting Trump's anti-democratic agenda
