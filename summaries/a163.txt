Insisting On The Impossible: The Life of Edwin Land and Instant: The Story of Polaroid

Land's Philosophy on Innovation and Work

• Land believed in "bull's eye empiricism" - trying everything but trying the right thing first, defying conventional marketing wisdom by creating products people didn't know they wanted until they were available.
• His work ethic centered on intense concentration: "My whole life has been spent trying to teach people that intense concentration for hour after hour can bring out in people resources they didn't know they had."
• He advocated for autonomy and immediate contribution, believing students should rapidly move through past knowledge to reach domains where they could do original work, rather than spending years preparing.
• His guiding principle was "don't do anything that someone else can do" - focusing only on problems that required unique brilliance and would add something the world wouldn't have otherwise.

The Invention of Instant Photography

• The Polaroid camera was conceived in 1943 when Land's 3-year-old daughter asked "why can't I see the picture now?" He spent hours that night roughing out the solution, though he joked it took from 1943 to 1972 to solve all the details.
• At the 1947 product demonstration, Land photographed himself and produced an instant sepia portrait the same size as his face, causing gasps in the room - reporters immediately demanded he do it again.
• The product exceeded all expectations: Land predicted 50,000 cameras per year might sell, but 900,000 units sold by 1953, with the first 56 cameras selling out on launch day in 1948.
• Land envisioned a camera "as simple as a pencil or eyeglasses, something you would use all day long" - essentially predicting the smartphone camera decades before it existed.

The Steve Jobs Connection

• Jobs called Land "a national treasure" and considered him his primary hero, modeling much of his approach after Land's philosophy and methods.
• Both were college dropouts who created revolutionary products through obsessive refinement, elegant design, and refusing to rely on market research, instead determining what people would want before they knew it themselves.
• Like Land, Jobs believed the goal was making great products first, with profits as a secondary byproduct: "Some people say give the customers what they want, but that's not my approach. Our job is to figure out what they're going to want before they do."
• Both faced similar fates: being pushed out of companies they founded after boards disagreed with their relentless investment in R&D over short-term profits.

Building Polaroid as a One-Man Company

• Land maintained absolute control over Polaroid for nearly 40 years, circulating among offices "roving, probing, asking questions," sometimes making late-night calls to employees or hiding in darkrooms to think.
• He created an environment where a researcher could spend two solid years just thinking before starting work - possible only because Polaroid's film had 60% profit margins from its patented monopoly.
• Land's perfectionism extended to every detail: demanding tulips flown from Holland for product demonstrations, insisting cameras fit in coat pockets, and requiring viewfinders show subjects "as if just gazing at them seamlessly."
• His motto "if anything is worth doing, it's worth doing to excess" drove both spectacular innovations and eventually contributed to the company's downfall through massive R&D spending.

The Kodak Patent War

• When Kodak violated Polaroid's instant camera patents in the 1970s, Land was furious: "We took nothing from anybody. The only thing keeping us alive is our brilliance. The only thing that keeps our brilliance alive is our patents."
• Land's testimony was masterful - charming, cantankerous, correcting lawyers and making perfect analogies while defending the holistic, integrated nature of the SX-70 system.
• Polaroid won the largest patent infringement judgment ever: $909 million in 1990, with seven patents upheld against Kodak's inferior "big and dumpy" cameras.
• The victory vindicated Land's approach of building entirely new inventions rather than incremental improvements on existing products.

Decline After Land's Departure

• After Land's retirement, Polaroid shifted from his philosophy of "making things people didn't know they wanted" to asking the world what it wanted and making that instead.
• The company abandoned Land's principle of "don't do anything that someone else can do," instead creating "mildly differentiated versions of things people want and use already" like floppy disks and videotapes.
• Land's successor failed to cannibalize Polaroid's own products with revolutionary new inventions, missing the technology company imperative to constantly leapfrog predecessors and supersede competitors.
• The transformation illustrated Land's warning: whereas his Polaroid was "built on belief that every significant invention must come to a world that is not prepared for it," the new Polaroid merely responded to existing market demands.
