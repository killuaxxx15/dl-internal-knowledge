DOGE updates + Liberation Day Tariff Reactions with Ben Shapiro and Antonio Gracias

Antonio Gracias's Role in Government and the DOGE Initiative

• Antonio Gracias, traditionally a Democrat for 20 years and major donor, is now working with the Trump administration while maintaining his day job at Valor, bringing two professionals from Valor to help with his government work
• Initially volunteered to work at VA but was asked by Elon Musk to go to the Social Security Administration (SSA) first to identify fraud, waste, and abuse
• Joined an existing team at SSA that was already working on "enumeration" - the system that assigns social security numbers
• His mandate as part of DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) is specifically to target fraud, waste, and abuse in government systems

Social Security Number Issuance to Non-Citizens Analysis

• Gracias presented a chart showing an unprecedented spike in social security numbers issued to non-citizens, from a baseline of 300,000-400,000 to 2.1 million
• The program "Enumeration Beyond Entry" started in 2017 for legitimate purposes but saw dramatic growth under the Biden administration
• Analysis revealed about 5.4 million people total in the program, with approximately 1.2 million marked as "unknown" status and another 1.2 million marked as "general parole"
• Requirements for asylum were significantly loosened - from a detailed four-page form to just four leading questions, massively opening the aperture for entry
• There was inadequate ID verification in the process, with suspicious patterns like birth dates disproportionately entered as January 1st (four times more likely than any other date)

Downstream Effects of Social Security Number Issuance

• People who received SSNs through this process could access all benefit programs - 1.3 million are currently on Medicaid
• Gracias's team discovered thousands of these individuals had registered to vote in several states, with many having actually voted, which is a federal crime
• When the data was sent to the National Targeting Center, they identified "hard hits" including criminals and people on terrorist watch lists
• The process allowed people who entered with "Notice to Appear" court dates (often scheduled 6+ years out) to apply for asylum, work authorization, and automatically receive a social security card without interviews
• 23% of the records examined did not have fingerprints, and border agents were reportedly overwhelmed during the surge, with over 70 agents committing suicide during this period

Debate About the Data and Responses

• Critics like Jim Chanos attempted to challenge Gracias's data, but Gracias maintained they were comparing "apples to oranges" by looking at total enumeration versus just the Enumeration Beyond Entry program
• When asked about potential solutions, Gracias indicated they're currently analyzing different legal statuses and have referred some cases for prosecution
• The team is continuing to analyze the data to determine appropriate actions for different categories of individuals
• Gracias emphasized this is not a political issue but about American democracy and security
• The investigation represents just "the tip of the iceberg" compared to the total 7.8 million people ICE has identified as in the country illegally

Immigration Policy Discussion

• Shapiro argued there's been a long-standing consensus among Americans to stop illegal immigration at the southern border
• Panelists debated whether to "deport everybody" or focus on criminals and those drawing on welfare benefits
• Gracias highlighted the human trafficking aspect, noting people paid $20,000+ to cross the border through cartel-controlled territory, creating indentured servitude situations
• Antonio emphasized this created a "human rights tragedy" that incentivized people to risk their lives and pay traffickers
• The panelists discussed finding legal pathways for immigration while addressing the current situation

Trump Administration's Tariff Policy

• The Trump administration recently announced significant tariffs, which Shapiro criticized as poorly rolled out with contradictory justifications
• The tariffs were presented as achieving multiple goals: raising revenue, reshoring manufacturing, and rejiggering the world trading system, some of which may be mutually exclusive
• There was confusion about the presentation of tariff rates, with some suggesting the administration was using the trade deficit divided by imports rather than actual tariff rates
• Several countries including Israel had removed tariffs on US goods but were still hit with new tariffs
• The total economic impact was estimated at $750 billion to $1 trillion, much higher than Wall Street's initial projection of $250 billion

Economic Consequences of Tariffs

• David Sacks identified three major consequences: 1) decline in competitiveness for American businesses when protected from foreign competition, 2) potential loss of revenue requiring government support payments like the $28B given to farmers in 2018-2019, and 3) China potentially disregarding IP rights in retaliation
• Chamath Palihapitiya noted the tariffs helped drive down the 10-year Treasury yield to nearly 4%, potentially saving hundreds of billions in financing costs for the government's $6 trillion debt needs
• The panel discussed the risk of recession and the need for the Federal Reserve to potentially lower rates to offset economic impact
• Chamath highlighted how tariffs hurt American companies competing with China, giving an example of a 100+ year-old American company that would swing from profitability to hundreds of millions in losses
• The rising CDS (Credit Default Swap) spreads were identified as a warning sign for potential corporate debt problems in the private economy

America's Competitive Position vs. China

• The panel discussed the importance of maintaining American entrepreneurial advantage through immigration of talented individuals, M&A transactions, and keeping an open business environment
• Ben Shapiro argued that China's economic fascism (using capitalist methodologies with a tyrannical government) can appear to work in the short-term but often leads to blind alleys
• David Sacks pointed out China's advantages, including their advancement in semiconductor manufacturing with 3nm technology coming in 2025-2026, their control of minerals, manufacturing capacity, and now software
• The panelists contrasted America's entrepreneurial culture with China's central planning, noting how Xi Jinping hobbled Chinese tech firms like Jack Ma's companies when they became too successful
• Friedberg suggested America needs to regain its sense of ambition similar to what China is demonstrating with massive infrastructure projects like 30,000 miles of high-speed rail

Potential for Global Economic Reordering

• Treasury Secretary Scott Besant suggested the possibility of a "grand global economic reordering" comparable to the Bretton Woods agreement
• The panel questioned what would replace the dollar as the world's reserve currency if there was less demand for dollars globally
• Stablecoins were discussed as a potential mechanism to maintain demand for US treasuries, similar to how Japan manages its high debt-to-GDP ratio through domestic buyers
• Panelists speculated whether AI could serve as an "anchor asset" for a new global economic system
• Chamath emphasized that most Americans, including Democrats, would agree with addressing the immigration problems once they understand the data

Political Risks of Economic Downturn

• Ben Shapiro warned that an economic recession could severely damage the Trump administration and lead to populist revolts on both left and right
• He suggested both parties could embrace policies like the Lina Khan antitrust approach that would harm innovation
• Shapiro argued that in a recession, tech companies standing near Trump would be caught in the fallout, leading to resurgent Bernieism on the left
• The panel discussed the challenge of making the bottom half of society feel included in wealth generation
• Shapiro suggested Trump should emphasize that blue collar workers are succeeding rather than getting "screwed," noting that Americans today have better living standards than in previous decades

Infrastructure and Employment Challenges

• The panel discussed a shortage of skilled workers in critical sectors, with 25% of utility workers becoming eligible for retirement between 2017-2022
• 56% of utility workers now have less than a decade of experience, leading to service interruptions
• According to NERC, 19 states can face rolling blackouts during normal peak conditions
• There's a shortage of workers for projects like building nuclear submarines, with one organization needing 100,000 workers but finding only a few hundred
• The panelists argued America needs to celebrate success and entrepreneurship while removing obstacles to individual advancement
