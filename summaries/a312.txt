Andy Grove (Intel)

Surviving the Holocaust and WWII Budapest (Ages 6–9)

• Grove's father was conscripted to the Russian front in a Jewish labor battalion; only 10% survived, and the family presumed him dead for years.
• Grove and his mother endured German occupation, food restrictions, forced relocation to "Star Houses," and the requirement to wear yellow stars of David.
• His mother forged false Catholic identities (renaming him "Andras Malesevics") to hide their Jewish heritage — a survival skill Grove internalized as a child.
• Soviet soldiers liberated Budapest but immediately committed atrocities, including raping women in the cellars where families hid.

The Power to Endure — His Mother's Extraordinary Resilience

• Grove's mother was nearly permanently imprisoned for the "crime" of allowing a neighbor to feed them; she was saved only by a chance encounter with a former business acquaintance.
• She independently navigated wartime bureaucracy, forged papers, relocated her child multiple times, and shielded him from the worst of what was happening.
• Grove dedicates the book to her with the line: "To my mother, who gave me the gift of life more than once."

Life Under Communism — Incompetence and Suppression (Ages 9–20)
• After the Soviets replaced the Germans, the communist government nationalized the family's dairy business and demoted his father to a low-wage state job.
• Grove was initially rejected from university as a "class alien" (for having been an employer); a well-connected professor secretly removed the offending paperwork to get him admitted.
• He learned early that survival required hiding one's true thoughts — a formative experience that later shaped his management philosophy of radical transparency at Intel.

The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the Escape

• A landmark public confessional by journalists admitting they had been lying to the public for years ignited the revolution; Grove witnessed flags with the communist emblem literally cut out.
• The uprising was crushed by Soviet tanks within 13 days, and young people were being rounded up at random by Russian soldiers — Grove's Auschwitz-survivor aunt urged him to flee immediately.
• He escaped at night through rural Hungary guided by a hunchback smuggler who materialized from the darkness to redirect the group, finally reaching Austria where a stranger confirmed they had crossed the border.

The Journey to America — Persistence and Gratitude

• Rejected initially by the International Rescue Committee (IRC) for a U.S. visa slot, Grove ran through the streets, pushed to the front of another interview line, and talked his way in with sheer volume and determination.
• He arrived in New York having never seen a TV, tasted real coffee, eaten a banana, or witnessed a world not organized around scarcity and war — describing American abundance as genuinely incomprehensible.
• Grove saved every spare nickel to eventually bring his parents to California, never forgetting the individuals and organizations that helped him; all royalties from Swimming Across go to the IRC.

From Refugee to Intel CEO — Lessons That Shaped a Leader

• Grove's management style at Intel — flat hierarchy, no private offices, vigorous open debate, "only the paranoid survive" — was directly informed by witnessing the catastrophic incompetence of centralized communist authority.
• He developed a key life insight as a student: "It's good to have at least two interests. If one goes sour, the other acts as a counterbalance."
• Named Time Magazine's Man of the Year in 1997, he reflected that no one in America ever resented his success for being an immigrant — a contrast to every system he had previously lived under.
