Oren Cass & Noah Smith Debate the True Impact of Tariffs

Conservative Alternative to Market Orthodoxy

• Oren Cass founded American Compass in 2020 to restore economic consensus emphasizing family, community, and industry over pure market efficiency
• Challenges the assumption that maximizing corporate profits automatically benefits everyone, pointing to unequal outcomes
• Argues markets don't guarantee preservation of values conservatives care about most
• Advocates for economic policy that goes beyond trusting market outcomes alone

Limitations of Economic Models

• Traditional comparative advantage models use oversimplified two-country, two-good scenarios with agricultural products
• Real economy involves manufactured goods where advantages come from policy choices, not natural endowments
• Countries can exchange goods for assets (like Treasury debt) rather than goods for goods, creating trade deficits
• Free trade with non-market economies like China actually hinders rather than advances free markets

Short-term Pain vs. Long-term Gain

• Current manufacturing indicators show contraction following Trump's tariff announcements, with declining PMIs and investment plans
• Cass acknowledges short-term disruption but expects positive results within 3-5 years as investment decisions shift
• Smith points to manufacturing employment, industrial output, and factory construction data showing immediate negative effects
• Disagreement over whether current data reflects economist predictions coming true or temporary adjustment period

Scale Economics and Allied Trade

• Smith advocates for free trade with allies (Europe, Japan, Korea) to achieve manufacturing scale comparable to China's domestic market
• Argues gross exports matter more than trade deficits for manufacturing competitiveness
• Proposes pooling markets with allies while maintaining tariffs against China for strategic industries
• Cass agrees on ally cooperation but notes these countries also run large trade surpluses with the US

American Economic Tradition

• High tariffs, restricted immigration, and industrial policy were standard American practices until recently
• Smith distinguishes between tariffs as negotiating threats versus permanent protectionist policy
• Both agree China represents a special case requiring different treatment than market economies
• Discussion of whether current approach mimics Chinese strategy versus restoring American historical norms
