Singapore FM Balakrishnan on Global Balance of Power

US Global Leadership in Historical Context

• The United States' role as global underwriter for eight decades was historically unprecedented, rebuilding former adversaries and establishing rules-based globalization rather than conquering them after WWII.
• The US provided markets, technology, capital, and rules-based economic integration that benefited Europe, Japan, Asian Tigers, and especially China.
• America's middle class experienced deindustrialization and income stagnation while underwriting this system, making domestic political pushback against globalization completely legitimate.
• The current shift represents fundamental geopolitical climate change, not temporary weather—a gradual build-up of pressure that has suddenly manifested.

The US-China Strategic Competition

• The US faces its first peer competitor in 249 years with China's scale and ability to reshape global order, though China remains a middle-income country unable or unwilling to replace the US as globalization's underwriter.
• The fundamental problem between the US and China is an almost complete lack of strategic trust, causing both sides to assume the worst and view precautionary measures as escalatory.
• Recent US-China agreements represent a tactical pause rather than strategic reconciliation, with both sides identifying pain points to manage competition.
• President Trump's positions on trade, war, and immigration have been remarkably consistent for decades, reflecting long-held convictions despite novel presentation methods.

ASEAN's Strategic Positioning and Growth

• ASEAN has a population slightly larger than the EU, ranks fifth in combined GDP, and could double GDP over the next two decades with half its population under 35 and a growing middle class.
• The region upgraded trade agreements within ASEAN and with China in 2025, focusing on becoming a single production and investment zone while building bridges globally.
• For Singapore, free trade is lifeblood—with trade volume three times GDP and size twice that of Gaza with three times the population, rules-based trade is existential, not negotiable.
• Southeast Asia represents a zone of hope and growth by focusing on long-term fundamentals rather than overreacting to short-term tariff headlines.

Global Trade System Realignment

• Most US trading partners chose not to retaliate against tariffs, paying the higher price for US market access while pursuing liberalization elsewhere—avoiding a global retaliatory trade war.
• The world is transitioning from having an underwriter-enforcer to an "interregnum" where the US has become "disrupter-in-chief" for domestic political reasons.
• Free traders failed to make the political case domestically, not addressing that every trade agreement creates winners and losers requiring compensatory mechanisms and safety nets.
• Opportunities exist for countries to forge new trade relationships and catch emerging trends during this period of realignment.

Technological Revolutions and Infrastructure

• Three technological revolutions are occurring simultaneously in real-time: artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and renewable energy.
• ASEAN is focusing on building infrastructure for these technologies and educating a workforce ready for a world of AI and robotics.
• China has significant productive capacity in green energy, AI, and biotech that could serve infrastructure development needs in Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America.
• Long-term strategy requires active government involvement in infrastructure, education, and pro-enterprise regulatory environments without state-directed capitalism picking winners and losers.

Unsustainable Global Imbalances

• The world has operated on unsustainable imbalances: outsourcing all manufacturing to China, energy to Russia, and security to America (particularly referencing the EU).
• Western consumers enjoyed low inflation and affordable goods while consuming beyond production levels, with Chinese trade surpluses recycled into Treasury bills.
• China may need domestic economic structural changes as the US and EU restrict access to their markets, raising questions about expanding domestic consumption versus continued export orientation.
• Strategic autonomy for regions like the EU requires addressing manufacturing capacity, defense, and energy policies rather than maintaining current dependencies.
