Charlie Munger (Poor Charlie’s Almanack)

Building a Latticework of Mental Models

• Munger advocates for a multidisciplinary approach, arguing that relying on a single discipline leads to the "man with a hammer" syndrome where every problem looks like a nail.
• Investors must construct a "latticework of mental models" derived from physics, biology, and psychology to hang their actual and vicarious experiences upon for better cognition.
• Key models include the redundancy backup system from engineering, compound interest from math, and the breakpoint or "lollapalooza" effect from physics.
• Academia is criticized for its "balkanization," which discourages the necessary jumping of jurisdictional boundaries required for true worldly wisdom.

Investment Strategy: Patience and Aggressive Betting

• Munger and Buffett practice "sit on your a** investing," characterized by extreme patience followed by extreme decisiveness when a rare, high-conviction opportunity arises.
• Success relies on betting heavily when the odds are extremely favorable, as opposed to the common practice of diversification, which Munger views as protection for the ignorant.
• They focus on purchasing companies with deep "moats," or competitive advantages, that protect them from destruction over the long term, such as Coca-Cola.
• Munger criticizes the efficient market theory, noting that he and Buffett have beaten the market by exploiting the foolish behavior of others who follow crowd folly.

The Principle of Inversion and Avoiding Misery

• Instead of asking how to achieve happiness, Munger applies the mathematician Jacobi's rule of "invert, always invert" to determine what causes misery and then rigorously avoids those traits.
• Munger outlines a prescription for misery that includes being unreliable, learning only from personal experience rather than others, and giving up after facing adversity.
• Unreliability is singled out as a fatal flaw that can negate all other virtues, causing talented individuals to be outperformed by "mediocre turtles".
• To avoid a miserable life, one must also rigorously avoid self-pity, envy, resentment, and the mind-numbing effects of heavy ideology.

The Necessity of Lifelong Learning

• Munger views the acquisition of wisdom as a moral duty and believes that people who rise in life are often "learning machines" rather than just the smartest individuals.
• He advocates for reading biographies to make friends with the "eminent dead," allowing one to learn vicariously from the successes and failures of historical figures.
• A key to success is the discipline of mastering the best of what other people have already figured out, rather than trying to dream up solutions independently.
• Warren Buffett and Munger "rub their noses" in their own mistakes, such as errors of omission, to ensure they learn and improve their decision-making processes.

The Superpower of Incentives and Psychology

• Munger posits that incentives are a "superpower" that determine behavior, illustrated by Federal Express solving shipping delays by paying employees per shift rather than per hour.
• Understanding the "psychology of misjudgment" is critical because even intelligent people make disastrous mistakes by ignoring how human brains are programmed to malfunction.
• He utilizes "Granny's Rule," which dictates that one must complete unpleasant and necessary tasks before rewarding themselves with pleasant ones.
• To persuade others effectively, one should always appeal to their interests rather than their reason, a lesson derived from Ben Franklin.

Habits for a Formidable and Durable Life

• Munger advises taking a simple idea and taking it very seriously, which is a strategy used by successful businesses like Costco to maximize specific variables.
• He emphasizes the importance of "durability" in business and life, admiring institutions and individuals that can survive and thrive over long periods.
• Individuals should strive to be "formidable" by adopting virtues such as thrift, duty, hard work, and simplicity, mirroring the advice of Ben Franklin.
• Intense interest in a subject is indispensable for excellence; Munger notes he could never excel in anything without a genuine, deep curiosity for it.
