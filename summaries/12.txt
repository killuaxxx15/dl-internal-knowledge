Kishore Mahbubani REVEALS China's Strategy to Counter USA

Lack of a Clear US Strategy Against China

• The US has initiated a strategic competition with China without a clear or coherent strategy, as highlighted by Henry Kissinger during a private discussion.
• The absence of defined goals leaves ambiguity regarding what the US aims to achieve, such as halting China's economic development, overthrowing the Communist Party, or isolating China—none of which appear feasible.
• President Biden's statements and policies, like tariffs and chip wars, mainly aim to prevent China's economy from overtaking the US economy during his presidency, highlighting an implicit goal of maintaining economic superiority.
• Kissinger emphasized the significance of having a deliberate strategic vision, indicating the current US approach lacks clear direction and long-term objectives.

Alternative Strategy: Cooperation and Multilateralism

• Kishore Mahbubani suggests the US adopt a cooperative approach rather than competitive containment, advocating for a world accommodating both the US and China as major powers.
• Former President Bill Clinton previously recommended building multilateral institutions, processes, rules, and norms that would effectively manage China’s rise without confrontation.
• Mahbubani argues this collaborative strategy would yield better outcomes for both nations and international stability, opposing the current zero-sum competition.

China's Clear Strategic Response

• China, recognizing itself as a relatively weaker party, has devised a clear and structured strategy to counteract US pressure.
• China closely studied the Soviet Union’s collapse, concluding that internal weaknesses—not external pressures—led to its demise, hence prioritizing internal economic vitality and social dynamism.
• Lessons learned from the Soviet collapse include bolstering internal strengths, notably through massive investment in education, infrastructure, and sustained economic growth.

Counteracting US Containment Policy through Economic Integration

• China proactively undermined potential containment strategies by economically integrating neighbors through initiatives such as the ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
• The ASEAN-China FTA dramatically shifted trade balances; ASEAN-China trade surged from $40 billion in 2000 to nearly $975 billion in 2022, surpassing ASEAN-US trade and effectively making ASEAN economically reliant on China.
• China's Belt and Road Initiative extended infrastructure development globally, cultivating economic reliance and discouraging international participation in US containment efforts.

China's Respect and Caution Toward the United States

• Despite strategic measures, China remains highly respectful and cautious of US capabilities, acknowledging its resilience and potential for formidable responses.
• The Chinese leadership recognizes America's historical and contemporary strengths, remaining mindful of the unpredictability and influence the US can exert globally.
