Jaishankar Breaks Down How US And China Are Rewriting Global Power In A Stunning 30 Minute Speech

Evolving Great Power Competition and Global Response

• The United States has altered its engagement strategy, moving away from acting as a system underwriter to dealing with nations on a one-on-one basis.
• China continues to operate by its own distinct set of rules, intensifying its established approach to global interaction.
• Nations are responding to these pressures by hedging against contingencies, avoiding binary choices where feasible, and exploring options among themselves.
• This fragmentation has led to a renewed enthusiasm for free trade agreements across different geographies.

Transformations in Global Production, Energy, and Finance

• Global manufacturing is heavily concentrated, with China accounting for one-third of production, highlighting the need for resilient supply chains.
• Energy dynamics have shifted significantly, with the US becoming a major fossil fuel exporter while China dominates the renewable energy sector.
• The financial landscape faces new realities, including the prolific use of sanctions, asset seizures, and the adoption of blockchain technologies.
• Trade prospects are increasingly volatile due to tariff rate fluctuations, supply-side risks, and demand-side uncertainty.

Technological Disruption and Resource Competition

• The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence toward Artificial General Intelligence is a major driver of change.
• Technological progress has directly intensified the competition for natural resources, particularly critical minerals and rare earths.
• The relative weight of nations is undergoing major changes across various domains, including technology, connectivity, and natural resources.

Redefining Connectivity and the Global Workforce

• Global connectivity is being reinvented to replace infrastructure originally designed to serve imperialist interests.
• The globalized economy is driving the mobility of talent and the rise of global capability centers, shifting both people and tasking.
• Demographic shifts mean many societies now rely on skills from abroad to maintain economic production and basic social services.
• New connectivity initiatives often serve dual purposes, combining market-driven goals with strategic intent.

India’s Strategic Response to New Realities

• India's response focuses on three pillars: advancing comprehensive national power, reducing vulnerabilities, and promoting influence.
• Diplomatic efforts are active rather than passive, aiming to facilitate technology flows and shape external sentiment regarding investment.
• The strategy includes opening global markets for Indian producers and securing work opportunities for Indian skills.
• India seeks to ensure a steady and predictable supply of its requirements from the world.

Imperatives for India's Industrial Growth

• To sustain its aspirations as a major power, India recognizes the necessity of possessing a significant industrial base.
• Policy priorities have shifted since 2014 to actively incentivize industrial growth, moving away from previous assumptions.
• The "Make in India" initiative is designed to be strengthened by domestic research, innovation, and design capabilities.
• Industry is urged to partner wholeheartedly and build domestic supply chains rather than focusing solely on the short term.
