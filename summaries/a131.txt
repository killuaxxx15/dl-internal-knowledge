Where did globalization go wrong?

The Promise vs. Reality of Globalization

• In the 1990s, political leaders like Bill Clinton expected globalization to create widespread prosperity domestically and promote political liberalization abroad, particularly in Russia and China
• By 2022, the world looked dramatically different with Russia invading Ukraine, US-China tensions, and significant domestic backlash against globalization
• The IMF estimates globalization lifted 1.5 billion people out of poverty worldwide, representing a remarkable achievement for developing nations
• However, the costs were concentrated among specific groups in the US, creating political resentment that ultimately led to backlash

Winners and Losers of Globalization

• Global winners included developing countries like China, India, and Vietnam, which followed export-led development strategies and integrated into global supply chains
• Domestic winners were generally higher-skilled, educated workers who could adapt to the new economy and benefit from lower prices and expanded opportunities
• Domestic losers were concentrated among less-educated manufacturing workers, particularly those in small towns dependent on single large factories
• The contrast between father and son Bob and Brian Ulrich illustrates this divide: the older worker struggled and went on disability, while the younger adapted through nursing school and eventually earned a six-figure salary

Policy Failures and Broken Promises

• Political leaders consistently promised that "winners would take care of losers" through retraining and social support, but these promises were never adequately fulfilled
• Under Clinton, deficit reduction became the priority; under Bush, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan took precedence; the financial crisis further diverted attention
• The Trade Adjustment Assistance Program has been chronically underfunded and ineffective, with studies showing participants often fared worse than those who sought jobs independently
• Both parties have focused on trying to bring back factory jobs rather than improving the quality and wages of service sector jobs that are actually being created

Strategic Costs: The TPP Withdrawal

• Trump's withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership on his fourth day in office damaged US credibility with allies after years of complex negotiations
• The move allowed China to fill the void by establishing its own trade agreements with many of the same countries
• While economic costs may have been limited through bilateral deals, the geostrategic costs were significant at a time when the US needs regional partners against China
• The decision made America appear erratic and untrustworthy to potential partners in the region

Lessons for Future Disruption (AI and Beyond)

• The "China shock" of 2000-2010 is over, but American workers will face new disruptions from artificial intelligence and the transition to a low-carbon economy
• Rather than building walls or running from change, the US should focus on social protection over protectionism
• Policy experimentation should emphasize active labor market programs and social support, drawing lessons from successful programs like the GI Bill
• The key is preparing proactively for disruption by identifying potential "losers" demographically and geographically, then developing support systems before they're needed
