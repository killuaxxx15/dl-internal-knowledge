Henry Wang on China's Role in the New Emerging World Order

China's Vision of Globalization

• China views globalization primarily through an economic lens, emphasizing trade, investment, and people-to-people exchanges rather than ideological alignment
• The country has benefited enormously from globalization, lifting 800 million people out of poverty and becoming the world's largest trading partner with 157 countries
• China advocates for economic cooperation over military alliances, opposing initiatives like AUKUS and NATO expansion to Asia
• Chinese leaders prefer "strategic stability" over "strategic rivalry" in U.S.-China relations

China's Geopolitical Philosophy and Cultural Roots

• China's agricultural heritage and 5,000-year history shape its non-expansionist approach to international relations
• Unlike maritime powers, China has not started wars, colonized territories, or invaded other countries in the past 40 years
• The country sees itself as providing global public goods through initiatives like Belt and Road, while the U.S. adopts more isolationist "America First" policies
• China is the largest contributor to UN peacekeeping forces among P5 members and supports existing international institutions

U.S.-China Trade and Economic Relations

• Trade tensions stem from narrow focus on goods deficits while ignoring service trade surpluses and multinational company profits
• China has become more resilient and confident, with ASEAN now its largest trading partner, pushing the U.S. to third or fourth place
• Both economies remain deeply interdependent - described as "conjoined twins" that cannot separate without damaging themselves
• Christmas shopping concerns and consumer impacts limit how aggressive either side can be with trade restrictions

China's Response to Global Conflicts

• China seeks to play a mediating role in conflicts like Russia-Ukraine, proposing BRICS peacekeeping forces as alternatives to NATO-led initiatives
• The country maintains that adding non-European peacekeepers (China, India, Brazil) could provide better security guarantees than European troops alone
• China advocates for UN reform to reflect the multipolar world, including adding G20 members as associate permanent members
• The approach emphasizes economic diplomacy over military intervention, consistent with China's preference for peaceful competition
