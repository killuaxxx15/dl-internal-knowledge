Leonardo da Vinci: The Biography

Leonardo as the Ultimate Polymath

• Embodied the intersection of arts, sciences, humanities, and technology - making connections across all disciplines
• His notebooks represent over 7,200 surviving pages (estimated quarter of his total work) documenting unprecedented curiosity and observation
• Compared to other Renaissance figures like Benjamin Franklin, Einstein, and Ada Lovelace who combined multiple fields
• Steve Jobs considered Leonardo his hero for seeing beauty in both art and engineering

Self-Education and Experience Over Theory

• Born out of wedlock, avoided formal Latin schooling, becoming proudly "unlettered" and self-taught
• Developed empirical approach that foreshadowed the scientific method by over a century
• Prioritized firsthand experience and experimentation over received wisdom and abstract theory
• Created detailed time-and-motion studies and precise observations that challenged traditional thinking

Revolutionary Anatomical Studies

• Dissected approximately 20 cadavers between 1508-1513, creating detailed drawings of every body part
• Made first documented description of arteriosclerosis by comparing a centenarian's vessels to a child's
• Studied comparative anatomy including woodpecker tongues and crocodile jaws to understand muscle mechanics
• Combined scientific precision with artistic beauty in anatomical illustrations

Creative Process and Work Methods

• Practiced deliberate procrastination, allowing ideas to "marinate" before execution
• Would spend hours contemplating paintings, sometimes adding only single brush strokes
• Carried the Mona Lisa for 20 years, continuously refining it until his death
• Believed "men of lofty genius sometimes accomplish most when they work least"

Engineering and Military Innovation

• Designed ambitious projects like river diversions, flying machines, and military fortifications
• Worked with Machiavelli and served ruthless patrons like Cesare Borgia
• Many projects were "too fanciful to execute" but demonstrated visionary thinking centuries ahead of his time
• Showed that "fantasies are paths to reality" - modern technology validates many of his concepts

Core Principles for Learning and Innovation

• Maintain relentless curiosity about everything, from yawning to planetary motion
• Seek knowledge for pure pleasure, not just practical application
• Go down rabbit holes and geek out on details others might consider insignificant
• Avoid intellectual silos by connecting insights across different fields of study
