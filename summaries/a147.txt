My Life and Work: The Autobiography of Henry Ford

Service and Frugality as Core Business Principles

• Ford's philosophy centered on service over profit, viewing business as a means to make the world better rather than simply generating wealth.
• He emphasized eliminating waste in all forms, which enabled him to continuously lower prices and pass savings to customers.
• When Ford reduced car prices from $1,000-$2,000 to $600-$750, sales increased nearly 5x, demonstrating that affordability unlocks mass markets.
• The business kept healthy cash reserves, sold for cash with no bad debts, and never borrowed money to cover mismanagement—only earning and reinvesting profits.

Rejecting Conventional Wisdom and "Experts"

• Ford deliberately avoided employing experts "in full bloom" because they focused on limitations and why things couldn't be done rather than exploring possibilities.
• When developing the internal combustion engine, virtually all experts dismissed it as having limited use compared to electric or steam power—yet it became foundational to modern industry (3.5% of U.S. GDP).
• He warned against extensive record-keeping of failures, which creates lists of "impossibilities" and blocks innovation rather than encouraging fresh attempts.
• Ford advocated reasoning from first principles rather than by analogy—people wrongly compared automobiles to bicycles instead of evaluating their unique potential.

Inequality, Work, and Personal Responsibility

• Ford stated bluntly that "all men are not equal" in ability and service capacity, arguing that pretending otherwise blocks progress and dishonors reality.
• He viewed work as the natural human state, with prosperity coming only through honest effort—idleness and seeking early retirement were signs of "sagging back."
• Success requires "stick-to-it-iveness"—primitive, stubborn persistence rather than brilliance or connections. More people are beaten by giving up than by actual failure.
• Ford believed financial security comes from within oneself, not from external circumstances or employers. Overcoming fear by becoming self-reliant brings true freedom.

Business Operations and Culture

• Ford rejected excessive meetings, memos, and forced "good fellowship" between employees—work time is for work, not building artificial family atmospheres.
• He emphasized fixing actual problems rather than throwing money at them: "More lathes will not cure it, neither will more money. Only heavier doses of brains and thought can cure."
• The company focused on constant improvement and eliminating even 10% inefficiencies, viewing any waste as an ongoing tax on operations.
• Ford advocated starting small, building through earnings, and viewing lack of profit as a signal the owner doesn't belong in that business.

Discipline Over Motivation

• Ford had no sympathy for those needing "good feeling" to do their work, calling them "soft and flabby" with insufficient mental and moral hardness.
• Discipline matters more than feelings or motivation—work must continue regardless of emotional state or temporary circumstances.
• Fear of failure is the real limitation, not failure itself. Failure is simply "the opportunity more intelligently to begin again" with no disgrace in honest attempts.

Four Principles of Ford's Business Philosophy

• Absence of fear of the future or veneration of the past—the past is only useful for suggesting better methods going forward.
• Disregard of competition—focus on doing the best work rather than trying to take business from others through lower standards.
• Putting service before profit—profit must be the reward for good service, not the basis of business.
• Manufacturing as transformation, not speculation—buy materials fairly, add minimal cost through efficient processes, and distribute to consumers without gambling or sharp dealing.
