Ending the ICE age: Kunal Khattar on the trillion dollar EV opportunity in India

About Kunal Khattar and Advantage Founders
Founder-Centric Investment Philosophy

• Kunal Khattar is the founding managing partner of Advantage Founders (intentionally named with "Founders" after "Advantage" rather than "Capital" or "Venture")
• The fund's North Star metric is creating 100 successful founders, believing that if they achieve this, everything else (successful businesses, unicorns, superior returns) will follow
• They call themselves "invest-a-preneurs" rather than traditional analyst/principal/VP titles, and consider the fund as Kunal's fourth startup rather than just a fund
• The team comes from an operating background, with Kunal having 7.5 years of experience running Carnation Auto before starting the fund in 2015
• They position themselves as partners who exist to ensure founders become successful, differentiating from other funds through this founder-first approach

Fund Evolution and Strategy

• Started 10 years ago with the recognition that building successful companies in India is like a marathon race done in multiple hundred-meter sprints
• The fund follows a sector-focused approach in mobility, which doesn't allow them the luxury of jumping between hot sectors like crypto, edtech, or AI
• They have created eight category leaders in the mobility space, with companies like Rapido (unicorn), Chalo, Park Plus, ZingBus, and Exponent Energy
• Currently raising their third fund of $60-75 million, having retained 100% of LPs from previous funds including anchor investors like Motherson and Hero Group
• They focus on understanding trends before others and timing investments for J-curve growth that will happen in the next 3-5 years

The Trillion-Dollar Opportunity: India's "Suzuki 2.0" Moment
Historical Context of India's ICE Ecosystem

• Suzuki's entry into India in 1985-87 created the entire internal combustion engine (ICE) ecosystem from scratch, as India had no auto industry before
• Suzuki brought multiple joint ventures (Motherson, Sumitomo, Sona, Koyo, Lumax, Anand) that collectively are now worth $150-160 billion
• The company established good manufacturing practices, sent Indians abroad for training, created the 3S dealership model (sales, service, spares) with 16,000 dealerships worth $150-200 billion
• Suzuki's ecosystem enabled vehicle financing through banks like HDFC and ICICI, created the car insurance industry, and spawned the aftermarket sector including companies like Cars24 and Spinny
• This entire ICE value chain, including 35+ four-wheeler OEMs and two-wheeler manufacturers, is now worth over a trillion dollars

The EV Disruption Parallel

• The transition from ICE to EV will create a similar trillion-dollar opportunity by disrupting existing players across components, OEMs, dealerships, financing, insurance, and energy distribution
• India imports $190 billion worth of crude oil annually, and the EV transition will significantly reduce this dependency
• The fund positions itself as funding "picks and shovels" companies - the building blocks for the EV transition including component manufacturers, OEMs, financing/leasing companies, insurance providers, and energy distribution companies
• This transition will take 30-40 years, similar to how the ICE ecosystem developed, but will create equivalent market capitalization in the EV space
• Many legacy companies will transition and remain leaders, but many will also get disrupted, creating opportunities for new-age players

India's Unique EV Ecosystem Strategy
Focus on Indian Form Factors

• India's vehicle market is fundamentally different from America and China, which are 98-99% four-wheeler markets
• India is predominantly a two-wheeler country and the largest market for two-wheelers, three-wheelers, buses, and trucks
• The fund focuses on form factors where India is already a market leader in ICE, rather than trying to compete in four-wheelers where India lags
• They identified e-rickshaws, two-wheelers, three-wheelers, and buses as more affordable transport options for Indian masses, as less than 1% of Indians can afford four-wheelers
• This approach allows India to build world-class, market-leading companies in segments where it already has expertise and market dominance

Commercial Vehicle Prioritization

• Commercial vehicles represent only 10% of vehicles on Indian roads but consume 70% of energy and contribute 70% of vehicular pollution
• Electrifying just 10% of vehicles (commercial ones) would reduce 70% of vehicular pollution and save $150 billion in crude oil imports annually
• Commercial vehicles are income-generating assets driven 5-10x more than personal vehicles, making the economic case for electrification stronger
• The transition provides higher operating leverage due to lower energy costs, making the entire EV infrastructure more competitive and cheaper for everyone
• Commercial vehicles serve lower-income groups (taxi drivers, delivery personnel, bus drivers), so electrification improves both environmental outcomes and income levels

Investment Philosophy and Timing
J-Curve Growth Strategy

• The fund invests in opportunities that will experience J-curve growth in the next 3-5 years, avoiding both too-early and too-late investments
• In 2015, they focused on shared mobility when it was at ground zero, but today would not invest in shared mobility as companies like Rapido are already valued at $300-500 million
• They avoided EV investments 10 years ago as the timing wasn't right, but post-COVID alignment of factors (lithium-ion price drops, infrastructure development, government support) makes the next 4-5 years ideal for EV J-curve growth
• The sector-focused approach requires superior trend recognition since they can't pivot to hot sectors like generalist funds
• They target the "sweet spot" where J-curve growth is 3-5 years away, avoiding the time value of money issues that come with too-early investments

Stage and Capital Focus

• They specialize in the zero-to-one journey, preferring to be first institutional investors in pre-revenue companies
• They avoid businesses requiring early physical infrastructure investments as this limits flexibility and pivoting ability
• Their expertise lies in pre-seed and seed rounds with smaller checks but higher conviction and ownership
• They work closely with founders for 2-3 years until product-market fit is achieved, then hand over to larger funds for Series B/C growth capital
• A $75 million fund size allows them to make 3-4 investments per year with proper attention, avoiding over-capitalization that leads to suboptimal bets

Key Portfolio Companies and Success Stories
Rapido - Two-Wheeler Taxi Success

• Rapido emerged from the insight that Uber and Ola chose four-wheelers as their primary product, which wasn't suitable for India's income levels
• The company focused on two-wheeler taxis as a more affordable shared mobility solution for the Indian market
• Has become a unicorn and one of the fund's most successful investments from their first fund
• The company's transition to electric vehicles required specific form factors not available in consumer scooters, leading to investments in companies like Zeno to build suitable commercial bike variants
• Rapido's success demonstrates the fund's thesis about building category leaders in form factors suitable for Indian conditions

Exponent Energy - Fast Charging Technology

• Exponent addresses the three main barriers to EV adoption: perceived cost difference, range anxiety, and charging behavior concerns
• Their proprietary technology enables 0-100% charging in under 15 minutes and 20-80% top-up in less than 10 minutes
• This fast charging capability allows for smaller battery sizes (reducing vehicle cost), eliminates range anxiety, and maintains familiar refueling behavior
• The company prioritizes commercial vehicles over personal mobility, as a bus driving 600km/day provides equivalent energy sales to 2,000 scooters driving 50km/day
• They've built batteries for three-wheelers, buses, and are expanding to four-wheeler commercial applications, demonstrating the B2B picks-and-shovels approach

Other Notable Investments

• Chalo: Digitizing public transportation systems across India
• Park Plus: Providing parking solutions and infrastructure
• ZingBus: Using buses for intercity mobility solutions
• Moon Rider: Building electric tractors, capitalizing on free or subsidized electricity for farming communities ve sus diesel at 100 rupees/liter
• Pulse Energy: Developing a "UPI for energy" - unified energy interface for energy trading and distribution

Technology and Infrastructure Insights
Energy as a Commodity

• Energy is becoming fungible and tradable, similar to how UPI democratized financial transactions
• Electric vehicles can serve as virtual power plants, selling energy back to the grid through bi-directional charging during peak rate periods
• Time-of-day tariffing will emerge, with cheaper rates during solar generation hours and higher rates during peak demand periods
• The unified energy interface (UEI) being developed by portfolio company Pulse Energy will enable energy trading similar to how UPI enabled financial transactions
• This energy commoditization will create new revenue streams and business models across the EV ecosystem

India's Technology Development Path

• India is 15-20 years behind America in EV technology development, similar to how IT services evolved over 30 years from systems integration to AI capabilities
• Rather than directly competing with advanced economies on cutting-edge technology like solid-state batteries, India should focus on indigenous solutions suited to local conditions
• Indian market requirements (price consciousness, different environment, unique form factors, charging infrastructure challenges) necessitate different technological approaches
• The fund believes India shouldn't blindly follow China's model but should build better indigenous solutions suited to Indian conditions and capabilities
• Companies like Exponent and Moon Rider are developing innovative approaches to battery architecture and cooling systems specific to Indian use cases

Future Outlook and Challenges
Hydrogen Technology Assessment

• Hydrogen is currently where EV technology was 15-20 years ago and faces the same challenge of needing to be 10x better than incumbent technology to drive disruption
• For hydrogen to disrupt EVs (which took 50 years to disrupt ICE), it needs significant improvements in safety, convenience, price, and efficiency
• The fund estimates hydrogen adoption is 10-15 years away, with initial pilots likely in heavy vehicles like trucks and buses taking 5-8 years
• Hydrogen will not experience J-curve growth in the next 3-5 years, making it outside the fund's investment timeline
• The technology may eventually find applications in passenger vehicles, but this is likely 15+ years away

Last-Mile Delivery Electrification

• India's low average order values in food delivery and quick commerce drive 100% two-wheeler-based logistics
• The combination of food delivery and quick commerce has created strong demand for efficient, cost-effective last-mile solutions
• Low-speed, low-capacity electric scooters are perfectly suited for these applications due to significantly lower operating costs compared to ICE vehicles
• Companies like Yulu and Baas are well-positioned to provide scalable solutions for last-mile businesses
• The fund expects this segment to see complete electrification within the next five years due to compelling economics

Ecosystem Building and Collaboration

• The fund emphasizes collaboration over competition, actively sharing research and insights with other investors to build the ecosystem
• They work with larger funds that have more capital, global exposure, and relationships with foreign investors and strategics
• Portfolio companies immediately benefit from the ecosystem, able to partner and collaborate with other portfolio companies
• The fund's approach creates a snowball effect where each new investment adds value to the entire ecosystem
• They position themselves as bringing sector expertise while partnering with others who bring complementary strengths like larger capital pools and international relationships
