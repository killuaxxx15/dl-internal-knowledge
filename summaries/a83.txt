Karl Rove: The triumph of William McKinley

McKinley's Military Heroism and Character

• Enlisted as a private in the Civil War and earned three battlefield promotions through extraordinary bravery, including two suicide missions at Antietam and Kernstown
• Known for his exceptional character in Congress - opponents respected him so much that seven Democrats crossed party lines to vote against his removal from office
• Thomas Brackett Reed noted that opponents felt "obliged to apologize to William before they criticize him"

Political Innovation and Campaign Strategy

• Ran the first modern primary campaign, systematically organizing in every state to win on the first ballot rather than through convention deal-making
• Pioneered the "Front Porch Campaign" where 750,000 people came to Canton, Ohio - an accidental innovation that became highly organized and effective
• Executed industrial-scale campaigning: printed 250 million pieces of material in 14 languages, conducted first micro-targeting with 5 million doubtful households

The 1896 Election Context and Parallels

• Five consecutive presidential elections before 1896 where no candidate received 50% of the vote, with 20 years of divided government and bitter political dysfunction
• Economic disruption from new technologies (electric lights, mechanical farming, refrigerated rail cars) created widespread insecurity and inequality concerns
• Immigration patterns were changing, bringing new groups from Eastern and Southern Europe who weren't tied to existing Civil War-era political loyalties

McKinley vs. Bryan: Contrasting Leadership Styles

• Bryan traveled 18,000 miles giving up to 16 speeches daily to 2-3 million people, often buying his own train tickets and sleeping wherever he could find a room
• McKinley focused on unifying rhetoric ("we're all in this together") while Bryan was divisive, calling opponents "dupes of the money power" and "bondmen of Lombard Street"
• The famous Cross of Gold speech resulted from seven historical accidents, and Bryan himself initially thought he had failed

Coalition Building and Modernization

• McKinley became the first Republican presidential candidate endorsed by a Catholic bishop and actively courted new immigrant groups (Croatians, Portuguese, Germans, Hungarians)
• Rejected the anti-Catholic American Protective Association despite their 63,000 Ohio members, maintaining "no religious test for office under the Constitution"
• Created a durable Republican coalition lasting 36 years, controlling the Senate for 30 years, White House for 28, and House for 26

The Role of Marcus Hanna - Myth vs. Reality

• Contrary to popular belief, Hanna was not the puppet master but more like "the bashful boy towards the girl he loves" (Herman Kohlsaat's description)
• During the 118-day general election, Hanna was away from Chicago headquarters for 70 days - the real campaign manager was 31-year-old Charles G. Dawes
• McKinley made the critical strategic decisions himself, often overruling Hanna's advice, and refused to make any promises about patronage or cabinet posts
