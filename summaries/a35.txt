Antonio Gracias: DOGE updates, Voter fraud, Finding 'Big Balls' | All-In Live from Miami

Government Complexity and Waste Assessment

• Antonio Gracias describes government operations as exponentially more complex than Twitter's acquisition, comparing Twitter to "JV League" while government is "the NBA" - the most complex system he's ever encountered
• Created a 40-foot mapping board of the border-to-benefits system that resembles a "Basquiat" painting due to its spaghetti-like complexity of interconnected processes
• Estimates that 15% of government spending could be easily cut without touching core entitlement programs, representing approximately $1 trillion in savings from the $7 trillion budget
• Notes that 88% of government employees who have left took voluntary, lucrative severance packages lasting about nine months, contradicting media reports about forced layoffs
• Emphasizes that the waste reduction targets people screaming about cuts because funding is being taken away from NGOs and beltway consultants who benefit from current inefficiencies

Social Security Administration Transformation

• Found completely empty parking lots and headquarters offices in Woodlawn, Maryland when he arrived, similar to the Twitter situation
• Discovered field offices operating with skeleton crews - only 3 out of 7 service windows were fully operational, with staff taking phone calls instead of serving in-person customers due to lingering COVID protocols
• Successfully brought all employees back to physical offices and restored full in-person service without closing a single field office
• Implemented public transparency by publishing website uptime metrics, showing improved performance since DOGE's involvement and allowing both staff and public to track progress
• Restored normal operations from COVID-era phone-only service model that was frustrating citizens waiting in lobbies while seeing understaffed service windows

Talent Recruitment and "Big Balls" Strategy

• Assembled an extraordinary team of young, highly capable engineers and professionals, many appearing to be in their early twenties but possessing exceptional technical skills
• Elon Musk's recruitment strategy involves personally responding to emails and tweets from people proposing solutions, then connecting them with vetting teams to assess feasibility
• Notable examples include "Big Balls" and other young engineers who are described as "10x engineers" that any company would be thrilled to hire
• Ethan, a Harvard student, dropped out with only two classes remaining to join the DOGE mission, demonstrating the mission's appeal to top talent
• Josh, a rising star and senior executive at KKR, left his prestigious private sector position to contribute to government reform efforts

Public Service Model and Cultural Change

• Advocates for a third category of government worker beyond career civil servants and political appointees - short-term public service contributors serving 18 months to 2 years
• Believes this model would benefit both government effectiveness and national unity by giving citizens direct experience with government operations and challenges
• Emphasizes that good people already exist within government who want to do the right thing but are trapped in bureaucratic systems that prevent effective action
• Cites examples of civil servants reporting serious issues like sex trafficking to Inspector General offices with no follow-up action, highlighting systemic dysfunction
• Focuses on creating cultural change that empowers existing good government employees to voice concerns and implement improvements through proper channels

Voter Fraud Investigation Findings

• Discovered through manual sampling of Department of Homeland Security data that illegal immigrants have registered to vote and actually voted in elections
• Process involves hand-checking names from work authorization databases against voter rolls, then coordinating with Homeland Security Investigations for verification through subpoenas
• Achieved three arrests in Florida and one federal indictment, with details publicly posted by DOJ but receiving minimal media coverage
• Highlighted case of Iraqi national who voted in 2020 in New York, later imprisoned for shooting someone's hand off, fraudulently claimed $60,000-70,000 in Medicaid benefits, and is now believed to be back in Iraq based on Facebook activity
• Engineering team can identify 10-20 cases per state in approximately one day of manual sampling, suggesting the problem may be significantly larger than currently known

Immigration Policy Framework

• Strongly supports both high-skilled and necessary labor immigration, citing personal family history as immigrants who built successful lives in America
• Notes America has approximately 7 million job openings and needs workers across skill levels, from technical positions to agricultural and service industry labor
• Advocates for streamlined legal immigration processes for both skilled workers and essential labor through programs like H2A, while maintaining controlled borders
• Emphasizes that open borders represent a surrender of national sovereignty, but controlled borders shouldn't prevent legal immigration for people who embrace American values
• Added "compassion" as a fourth core value for his DOGE team alongside focus, intensity, and discipline, reflecting the human impact of immigration policy decisions

Systemic Reforms and Technology Solutions

• Working to improve the SAVE database system that provides citizenship verification data to states, making the user interface more functional and accessible
• Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem signed a policy memo making the SAVE database API calls free, after the Biden administration had increased costs from $1 to over $3 per call
• Believes implementing Real ID requirements in the remaining 15 states without voter ID laws, combined with improved SAVE database access, would effectively eliminate voter fraud concerns
• Focuses on transparency and metrics publication to enable both government workers and the public to track performance and improvements in real-time
• Emphasizes the importance of striving for "zero-defect systems" in voting, comparing it to medical device manufacturing standards where precision and accuracy are non-negotiable
