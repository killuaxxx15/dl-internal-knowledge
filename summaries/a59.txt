IEA Oil 2025 Report Summary

Global Oil Demand Forecast to Peak This Decade

• Global oil demand is projected to increase by 2.5 mb/d from 2024 to 2030, reaching a plateau around 105.5 mb/d by the end of the decade, with annual growth slowing from roughly 700 kb/d in 2025-26 to just a trickle over the next several years.
• A small decline is expected in 2030 based on current policy settings and market trends, driven by below-trend economic growth, weighed down by global trade tensions and fiscal imbalances, and accelerating substitution away from oil in transport and power generation sectors.
• Electric vehicles are set to displace 5.4 mb/d of global oil demand by 2030, with global electric car sales exceeding 17 million in 2024 and expected to surpass 20 million in 2025, representing around one-quarter of all cars sold.
• Substitution away from oil will also feature prominently in power generation, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where displacement of oil burning by natural gas and renewables drives the single largest decline in oil demand for any country through 2030.
• Demand for oil from combustible fossil fuels (excluding petrochemical feedstocks and biofuels) may peak as early as 2027, with CO2 emissions from oil use forecast to hit an apex by 2027.

Petrochemicals Become Dominant Driver of Oil Demand Growth

• The petrochemical industry is set to become the dominant source of global oil demand growth from 2026 onwards, closely linked to the burgeoning supply of natural gas liquids (NGLs).
• By 2030, the production of polymers and synthetic fibres will require 18.4 mb/d of oil, or more than one in every six barrels, with petrochemical feedstocks' share of total oil consumption rising from 15.8% in 2024 to 17.4% by 2030.
• China and the United States lead the build-out of petrochemical capacity, at the expense of Europe and other economies in Asia, with feedstocks accounting for 24% of total oil demand in 2030 compared to 22% in 2024.
• The shift toward petrochemicals reflects steady growth in underlying plastics use rather than acceleration, as this sector is not subject to factors comparable to vehicle efficiency gains or widespread substitution effects on the scale of transport electrification.
• Rising use of oil products as raw materials for plastics and synthetic fibres cemented petrochemicals' dominance of overall oil demand growth in 2024, accounting for about three-quarters of net growth.

Regional Demand Patterns Show Stark Divergence

• Robust oil demand growth of 4.2 mb/d in emerging and developing economies over 2024-30 contrasts sharply with a continued contraction in advanced economies, with OECD oil consumption forecast to decline by 1.7 mb/d through 2030.
• India leads global demand growth with an expected 1 mb/d increase, the largest of any single country by far, driven by stellar GDP expansion at an average annual rate of 2.8% and rising middle-class consumption.
• China's total oil consumption in 2030 is now set to be only marginally higher than in 2024 (30 kb/d increase), compared with growth of around 1 mb/d forecast previously, due to rapid EV penetration and economic structural shifts.
• The United States sees an increase in forecast oil demand of 1.1 mb/d by 2030 compared to last year's report, due to lower gasoline prices and a loss of momentum in EV adoption, with EVs expected to account for 20% of US car sales in 2030, down from 55% assumed last year.
• Asian markets dominate growth overall, with rising oil use in Southeast Asian economies (Tiger Cubs) also significant, while consumption among OECD countries declines across all major regions.

Oil Supply Capacity Growth Outpaces Demand

• World oil production capacity is forecast to rise by 5.1 mb/d to 114.7 mb/d by 2030, led by Saudi Arabia and the United States, significantly outpacing the projected 2.5 mb/d increase in global oil demand.
• Global NGL production is expected to increase by 2.3 mb/d to 20.1 mb/d by 2030, accounting for nearly half the total increase in world oil production capacity, driven by strategic focus on natural gas developments by Middle East producers and associated gas from US shale operations.
• Net capacity growth through 2030 is roughly twice the projected increase in oil demand, with OPEC+ spare crude capacity (excluding Iran, Venezuela, and Russia) estimated to reach 6.5 mb/d in 2030.
• Supply capacity growth is heavily frontloaded, slipping from 1.8 mb/d in 2025 to contraction after 2029 as the pipeline of non-OPEC+ projects wanes, while mirroring demand trends.
• Based on current OPEC+ supply trajectory, implied stock builds of nearly 2 mb/d are projected at the end of the forecast period, suggesting downward pressure on prices.

US Shale Growth Slows While Other Regions Rise

• US liquids output growth is expected to slow markedly as crude plateaus, with light tight oil (LTO) production increasing by only 360 kb/d from 2024 to 2030, reaching 9.8 mb/d, while NGL growth remains more robust at 860 kb/d.
• The United States remains the second-largest contributor to medium-term supply capacity growth behind Saudi Arabia, adding 880 kb/d over 2024-30 to reach 21.1 mb/d, but crude oil production is expected to decline by 60 kb/d to 13.1 mb/d.
• Non-OPEC+ Americas quintet (United States, Canada, Brazil, Guyana, and Argentina) will boost production by 2.8 mb/d by 2030, with their combined output approaching one-third of global oil supply.
• Argentina's Vaca Muerta LTO production is projected to more than double from 400 kb/d in 2024 to 890 kb/d by 2030, supported by new takeaway capacity and economic reforms under President Milei.
• Production growth in Guyana and Brazil will lose momentum from 2028 onwards as the number of sanctioned projects tails off, while Canadian output benefits from improved pipeline egress and continued shale drilling.

OPEC+ Strategy Shifts Amid Market Pressures

• The OPEC+ alliance has begun unwinding voluntary supply cuts of more than 2 mb/d that have been in place since 2023, with a decision to start unwinding oil production curbs in May 2025 resetting oil supply trajectories.
• The group of eight OPEC+ countries that agreed to cut production by 2.2 mb/d announced 1.4 mb/d of target increases for May-July 2025, though only Saudi Arabia has room to substantially raise production.
• Saudi Arabia leads OPEC+ capacity growth through the decade, gaining almost 1.2 mb/d, primarily through massive Jafurah unconventional resource development and focus on natural gas to reduce crude oil use in power generation.
• The UAE is set to lead global crude oil capacity additions with over 720 kb/d by 2030, while Iraq increases capacity by 560 kb/d to 5.4 mb/d, though short of its 6 mb/d target due to infrastructure constraints.
• Combined with forecast slowdown in oil demand, the call on OPEC+ crude in 2030 is 1.2 mb/d below the average 2025 call, suggesting potential oversupply if current production levels are maintained.

Global Trade Patterns Undergo Major Shifts

• The Atlantic Basin crude surplus is expected to widen by approximately 870 kb/d to 7.1 mb/d by 2030, as European and US refining activity slows while oil supply in the Americas continues to expand.
• Middle East crude exports are projected to increase from 16.1 mb/d in 2024 to 17.9 mb/d by 2030, equivalent to the combined exports from the Americas, Africa, and Eurasia.
• Brazilian and Guyanese crude exports will increasingly head east as 800 kb/d of additional supplies boost Central and South America's crude exports to 4 mb/d by 2030, following the pattern of increased North American exports to Asia.
• The Middle East is set to lead regional product export gains over the decade, driven by higher LPG, naphtha, and fuel oil volumes, while several countries that drove recent expansion in product exports will see limited progress.
• Atlantic Basin product exports rise by 320 kb/d to 3.5 mb/d as regional demand for refined products contracts more rapidly than local production adjustments.

Refining Industry Faces Structural Challenges

• Global refined products demand is projected to peak in 2027 at 86.3 mb/d, only 710 kb/d above 2024 levels, before accelerating declines in gasoline and diesel use outweigh growth in naphtha and jet fuel.
• Despite tepid demand growth projections, 4.2 mb/d of new refining capacity is expected globally by 2030, partly offset by 1.6 mb/d of closures, with net capacity growth far exceeding refined product demand.
• The refining industry faces mounting challenges from oil demand growth underpinned almost exclusively by petrochemical feedstocks produced from non-refined products such as NGLs, marginalizing refineries' role in meeting petrochemical demand.
• High-cost regions like Europe and the US West Coast are most likely to see further capacity cuts, with announced shutdowns totaling 1.6 mb/d for 2025-30, equivalent to an annual decline of around 250 kb/d.
• Refineries must adapt to shifting demand dynamics with tougher challenges ahead, as the long-term trend of rising transport fuel demand that underpinned investment strategy for 50 years reverses.

European Refining Under Severe Pressure

• Europe faces the steepest regional decline in product demand at just over 900 kb/d to 12.8 mb/d by 2030, with refinery runs projected to drop nearly 900 kb/d and capacity at risk rising by 650 kb/d to 1.6 mb/d.
• European refiners face structurally challenging future with rising carbon compliance costs, as EU Emissions Trading System allowances increase from approximately EUR 30/t in 2021 to around EUR 70/t currently.
• No expansions or greenfield projects are expected in OECD Europe over the forecast period, with announced closures totaling 370 kb/d by 2030 and potential for substantially more in the latter part of the decade.
• Major 2025 closures include Shell's 150 kb/d Wesseling facility in Germany, BP's 80 kb/d Gelsenkirchen unit, and the 140 kb/d Petroineos Grangemouth facility in the UK, marking the region's largest annual capacity reduction since 2012.
• Free carbon allowance allocations for refineries are being progressively phased out, with allocations down 20% by 2025 relative to 2020 levels and expected to decline by over 40% by 2030.

US West Coast Refining Undergoes Major Contraction

• US West Coast (PADD 5) refining capacity faces sustained contraction with over 700 kb/d of crude distillation capacity closed or scheduled for closure between 2018 and 2026, representing nearly one-quarter of operational baseline.
• Recent and planned closures include Phillips 66's 120 kb/d Rodeo facility (2024), 140 kb/d Wilmington refinery (Q4 2025), and Valero's 145 kb/d Benicia refinery (H1 2026), leaving only 12 crude oil refineries in California.
• Closures are driven not by poor margins but by financial and policy challenges including stringent environmental compliance costs, extensive permitting hurdles, and unique fuel specifications like CARBOB gasoline.
• The pace of refinery closures outpaces the transition to EVs and more efficient vehicles, keeping the region net short on products and requiring continued imports, particularly gasoline from Asia and compliance with Jones Act restrictions.
• California imported nearly 50 kb/d of gasoline and blending components in 2024, largely from Asia, with few global refineries configured to meet the state's strict fuel standards.

Natural Gas Liquids Drive Supply Growth

• Global NGLs production is forecast to rise by 2.0 mb/d to 15.5 mb/d by 2030, with the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Canada accounting for 84% of current production and rising to 88% by 2030.
• The United States maintains overwhelming dominance with 51% market share, production set to increase from 6.9 mb/d in 2024 to 7.8 mb/d in 2030, while the Middle East boosts its share from 25% to 29% over the same period.
• Ethane demand expands by 610 kb/d from 2024 to 2030, reaching 5.2 mb/d, with the Middle East leading demand growth at 290 kb/d and the United States remaining both the largest exporter and consumer.
• LPG consumption will increase by 1.3 mb/d to 11.8 mb/d by 2030, with East of Suez markets accounting for two-thirds of overall demand growth, gaining 820 kb/d over the outlook period to reach 6.6 mb/d.
• Around 43% of LPG comes from refineries and the rest from NGL fractionation, with most incremental supply coming from fractionation which is forecast to rise 850 kb/d to 7.1 mb/d by 2030.

Economic and Geopolitical Uncertainties Shape Outlook

• Heightened geopolitical risks, unresolved trade tensions, and policy shifts have added uncertainties to oil market outlook, with major economic forecasters cutting world GDP growth in 2025 by roughly half a percentage point to around 2.8%.
• Global GDP growth is projected to average near 3% over 2025-30, almost half a point lower than during the 2010s, amid structural headwinds including aging populations, increased protectionism, and stretched government finances.
• The ratio of cross-border trade and investments to GDP has stalled over the past decade amid global retreat from free trade toward mercantilist policies, tariffs, and subsidies, with Baker, Bloom and Davis Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index surging to highest level ever in April 2025.
• China's growth will decline steadily over the outlook period, with GDP expansion sliding to 3.7% in 2030 from 7.3% in the 2010s, amid shrinking population, protracted property slump, and massive overcapacity challenges.
• Ongoing tensions between Iran and Israel, impact of western sanctions on Russia, Iran and Venezuela, and changes in who is buying sanctioned barrels remain key uncertainties, with access to technologies, financing and supply chain inputs potentially further impacted.

Investment and Exploration Trends Signal Industry Caution

• Global upstream oil and gas investment is set to decline by 4% in 2025 to around USD 565 billion, with upstream oil investments on track to fall by nearly 6% to USD 420 billion according to company guidance.
• The precipitous drop in oil prices in early 2025 and uncertain investment climate have prompted oil executives worldwide to reevaluate upstream priorities, with some of the largest declines in US light tight oil spending.
• Average exploration capital from 2015-24 was 30% lower than the previous ten-year average at USD 35 billion, with correlation between exploration capex and oil prices changing from 0.9 over 2000-14 to effectively zero from 2015-24.
• Just under 5 billion barrels of conventional liquid resources were discovered in 2024, replacing only 19% of conventional production last year, with four projects accounting for approximately half of discovered volumes.
• Peak production from conventional projects sanctioned during 2021-24 is expected to average 2.5 mb/d annually, slightly exceeding the 2015-19 previous five-year average of 2.1 mb/d but showing deceleration in project sanctioning.

Transport Sector Transformation Accelerates

• Working-from-home employment has reduced global road fuels demand by around 800 kb/d compared to 2019 levels, with this level of savings holding roughly steady through the forecast period to 2030.
• The United States accounts for nearly 800 kb/d of fuel use being avoided through teleworking, with WFH's share of paid workdays remaining stable from 2022 onwards at around 25-30% after soaring to 60% during 2020 lockdowns.
• Hybrid-driven vehicle fuel efficiency gains are cutting Japanese gasoline use, with Japan posting efficiency gains of around 1% per year and gasoline demand falling almost 15% below pre-pandemic levels in 2024 despite positive GDP growth.
• Cultural individualism emerges as the main driver for variance in WFH rates across countries, with full-time employees working from home in excess of 1.5 days per week in the United States, Canada and UK, leading other developed economies.
• Public transport use has been similarly transformed by the pandemic, with 2024 ridership in major European cities still 5-10% below pre-Covid levels and even larger declines in the United States, where subway ridership is 30% lower in New York and down 60% on California's BART system.

Aviation and Marine Sectors Face Efficiency Pressures

• The commercial aviation industry has completed recovery from the pandemic with record-high passenger numbers, but jet/kerosene consumption gains lag due to improved efficiencies counterbalancing robust underlying growth in air travel.
• Jet/kerosene use may not regain pre-Covid levels until 2027, four years after flight activity passed the same mark, despite reasonably constructive underlying demand outlook for the aviation sector.
• Advanced aircraft technologies including improved aerodynamics, lightweight materials, and enhanced engine propulsion combine to reduce drag, with new narrow-body models like Airbus320neo and Boeing 737 MAX about 20% more fuel-efficient than predecessors.
• Demand for marine fuels is expected to flatline at around 5 mb/d over the forecast period as subpar underlying growth in shipping combines with rising costs from ongoing tightening of marine decarbonization standards.
• UN International Maritime Organization emission standards will continue to tighten, with Mediterranean becoming Sulphur Emission Control Area in May 2025 and global greenhouse gas pricing system for merchant ships starting in 2028.
