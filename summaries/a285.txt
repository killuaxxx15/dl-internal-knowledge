Edwin Land (Polaroid and The Man Who Invented It)

Edwin Land's Total Dominance of Polaroid

• Land held virtually every major position at Polaroid for 45 years (1937-1982), serving as Chairman, President, CEO, COO, and Director of Research simultaneously.
• He held 533 patents (second only to Edison's 1,093) and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom and National Medal of Science despite never earning a college degree.
• The company and the man were inseparable and virtually indistinguishable throughout this period, with Land personally inventing most of Polaroid's products and processes.

A Mind-Centered Life and Creative Vision

• Land lived primarily in his internal world, creating self-generated dramas on the stage of Polaroid with minimal interest in others' reactions.
• His approach to life embodied creating one's own world within the world, being the star of his own movie with singular focus on his vision.
• This intense inward focus allowed him to pursue seemingly impossible innovations but also isolated him from those around him, including employees who revered but couldn't easily approach him.

Revolutionary Corporate Philosophy

• During the Depression, Land conceived a bizarre new type of company founded on science that would create products the public didn't yet know they needed.
• He envisioned work environments so satisfying that employees would look forward to each day and regret its end, a radical departure from prevailing industrial conditions.
• His company was designed to create an environment for art and innovation, not just manufacture products, representing one of his most original inventions.

The SX-70 and Overextension

• Land simultaneously pushed forward two highly complex products (SX-70 camera and Polar Vision video system) while production issues remained unresolved.
• Polar Vision's fundamental flaw was that "the why was never examined" - a two-and-a-half-minute soundless video format competing against superior alternatives.
• This overreach contributed to financial losses and ultimately to Land's forced departure from the company he founded.

The Kodak Patent Battle

• Polaroid engaged in what became the largest patent infringement lawsuit in history against Kodak, eventually winning nearly $1 billion in damages.
• Land retired to his office for months before the trial, emerging only for unavoidable occasions, then served as the star witness.
• His command of technology, process, and communication skills proved decisive in securing this historic legal victory.

A Difficult Ending

• Giving up Polaroid in 1982 was the hardest thing Land ever did, described as emotional trauma that engulfed everyone near him.
• He tore himself away from the most important thing in his life, accomplishing this "surgery on himself" in his characteristic personal, unexpected, passionate way.
• Despite running his company longer than Edison, Ford, or Eastman, the ending revealed deep lines of struggle as he maintained only an office contract for "the rest of his life and six months longer."
