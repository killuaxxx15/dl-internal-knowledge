The Foundation of Good Investments: Barriers to Entry

• High barriers to entry are the most critical factor in investment decisions - more important than growth rates or valuation multiples, as competition kills profits and substitution eliminates businesses
• Key moats include: irreplaceable physical assets (airports, toll roads), complex intellectual property (aircraft engines), network effects (Visa, Meta), customer switching costs (mission-critical software), and strong brands
• Growth without barriers to entry is dangerous - the airline industry exemplifies this with consistent 5% annual growth over 100 years but minimal cumulative profits due to low barriers

Investment Strategy: Long-Term Concentration

• TCI maintains an average holding period of 8 years (some positions held 13+ years), compared to the market average of under 1 year, viewing investments through a private equity lens
• The fund focuses on only ~200 companies globally that meet quality criteria, maintaining concentrated positions of ~10% holdings across 10-15 stocks
• Valuation matters less than intrinsic value growth over long periods - Hohn bought Moody's at 10x earnings, sold at 20x for a double, but had to buy back at higher prices as the business kept compounding

Pricing Power: The Hidden Value Driver

• Companies with true pricing power above inflation are rare but extremely valuable - 1% pricing above inflation with 20% margins means 5% faster profit growth
• Most investors overlook pricing power analysis, focusing only on volume growth plus inflation, missing this critical profit driver
• Essential products/services matter more than recurring revenue - rating agencies exemplify this as debt must eventually be refinanced and rated, even if timing varies

Activism Evolution: From Fighter to Owner

• Hohn transitioned from aggressive activism (forcing ABN AMRO's sale, fighting Deutsche Börse) to selective engagement, recognizing that fundamentals trump activism in bad businesses
• The Wirecard short exemplified the challenges - even being right doesn't guarantee profits due to unlimited downside risk and the need to fund losses while waiting for vindication
• Modern activism is harder with passive investing dominance - indexation has limited shareholder power compared to when TCI started 21 years ago

Organizational Philosophy: Small Teams & Intuition

• TCI maintains just 7-8 investment professionals, believing that small teams foster trust, culture, and retention of top talent who value environment over compensation
• Intuition plays a crucial role alongside analysis - described as "thinking without thinking" or pattern recognition developed through experience
• Team hiring focuses on philosophical alignment, ability to work collaboratively, and openness to being wrong rather than just analytical skills

Philanthropy as Life Purpose

• Hohn gives away everything he earns, with the foundation holding $6.5 billion and distributing over $500 million annually to climate change and children's health initiatives
• Remarkable ROI on humanitarian interventions: $10 prevents unwanted pregnancy, $40 saves a malnourished child, $50 prevents blindness from trachoma
• Views service as innate to human consciousness - distinguishes between personality (driven by desire/power) and soul (driven by service/purpose), believing everyone eventually discovers this truth through experience or crisis
