Who Is Michael Ovitz?

Early Career Foundation and Philosophy

• Michael Ovitz built his career on understanding people and making clients think they were friends, though he maintained clear boundaries about the transactional nature of these relationships.
• He developed a profound belief that nothing in Hollywood becomes something until you insist it is—success requires unwavering conviction in making possibilities become reality.
• His origins in the Valley shaped his entire life and drove his ambition, with those humble beginnings never leaving his mindset despite achieving massive success.

Building CAA into a Powerhouse

• Ovitz co-founded CAA with Ron Meyer as his blood brother and built it from nothing into an agency that reshaped the entertainment business.
• He was a kid from the Valley with no stature, network, or tenure who managed to completely transform the industry through sheer determination and strategic thinking.
• The agency attracted bright, creative colleagues and fostered intense camaraderie, which became the most valuable aspect of the business in retrospect.

The Cost of Success: Betrayal and Changed Relationships

• His closest relationships deteriorated as success grew: Jay Moloney (his protégé) disowned him, Michael Eisner publicly humiliated and fired him after 14 months at Disney, and Ron Meyer disparaged him around town for 20 years.
• The tools and strategies used to reach the top inevitably created resentment, even among those who shared in his success, fundamentally changing who he became as a person.
• He realized too late that his pursuit of money and power through intimidation destroyed human intimacy and turned potential friends into enemies.

Critical Self-Awareness and Mistakes

• Ovitz admits the autobiography is primarily about mistakes—not business errors, but failures in managing relationships and understanding people's feelings.
• Despite believing he understood people deeply and was too smart to be duped, he consistently misplaced his trust and misread the emotions of those closest to him.
• He acknowledges that while he made clients think they were friends, it was ultimately his clients who remained loyal while his actual friends betrayed him.

Late-Life Reconciliation and Reflection

• In his 70s, Ovitz initiated reconciliation with Ron Meyer through mediated sessions where both acknowledged their mistakes and resentments built over 20 years of animosity.
• He also reconciled with David Geffen, recognizing that the win nowadays is simply breaking even and finding peace with past conflicts.
• Returning to the empty CAA building, he realized the only thing he truly missed was the camaraderie and the passionate way he spent his life with colleagues—ultimately, it was all about the people, not the power or success.
