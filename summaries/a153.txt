Michael McFaul on Trump, Putin, and Autocrats vs. Democrats

Russia's Diminished Global Influence

• Russia's position in the Middle East has significantly weakened compared to a decade ago, with the collapse of the Assad regime, weakened Hamas and Hezbollah, and Iran's disappointment in Russia's lack of support during recent attacks.
• While Russia's state-to-state relations have deteriorated globally, Putin has been more successful at promoting illiberal nationalism and Putinism ideologically, particularly in Europe and the United States.
• Russia is more isolated internationally than 10-20 years ago, with China being the notable exception to this trend in terms of multilateral relations.

Putin vs. Xi: Different Revisionist Approaches

• Despite China's superior capabilities across all metrics (military, economic, GDP), Putin is far more revisionist in his intentions to undermine the global international order than Xi Jinping.
• Putin's ideological project focuses on illiberal nationalism for the developed world, while Xi's model targets the developing world (Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America, Middle East).
• The Soviet-era ideological threat was more global and totalitarian than China's current project, making historical Cold War comparisons inaccurate.

Trump's Failed Ukraine Strategy

• McFaul initially applauded Trump's engagement efforts with Russia to end the Ukraine war, including direct talks with Putin, as a necessary condition for mediation.
• However, Trump's approach of solely using inducements and concessions without coercive measures has failed, leaving the situation worse than before the Alaska summit.
• Unlike the Obama administration's dual-track approach with Iran (engagement plus pressure), Trump has implemented no new sanctions against Russia since returning to office, even as Putin has escalated attacks on Ukrainian civilians and probed NATO members Poland and Romania.

Lessons from the Obama "Reset"

• The Obama reset differed fundamentally from Trump's approach by pursuing concrete outcomes (New START treaty, Iran sanctions, Northern Distribution Network) rather than summits as ends in themselves.
• The reset followed George Shultz's blueprint of engaging adversaries without checking values at the door, including dual-track diplomacy that engaged both government and civil society.
• The broader strategic mistake across multiple administrations was failing to implement a hedge strategy—rapidly expanding NATO and EU membership and arming countries like Ukraine earlier when Russia was weak.

Russian Society and Elite Attitudes

• Economic elites overwhelmingly opposed both the 2014 Crimea annexation and the 2022 invasion, but lack courage to act against Putin despite having their assets frozen and lifestyles disrupted.
• Russian society divides roughly into: hardcore Putin supporters (30%+, older, less educated, rural), active opposition (20%, younger, urban, educated), and an apolitical middle that supports whoever is in power.
• There is no significant societal pressure to end the war, and after 25 years of Putin's rule, societal attitudes have fundamentally shifted—making democratic alternatives that seemed viable in the 1990s impossible today.

Putin's Contingent Rise and Accountability

• Putin was not an inevitable outcome—he was an accidental president with no mass following in 2000, elevated after the 1998 financial crash disrupted the planned succession to Boris Nemtsov.
• After 26 years of dictatorship, it's no longer just "Putin's war" but "Russia's war," with Russians directly committing atrocities, kidnapping children, and bearing societal responsibility.
• McFaul acknowledges changing his views based on new evidence, noting that some Russians inside Russia agree with this assessment of collective responsibility, though they cannot speak publicly.
