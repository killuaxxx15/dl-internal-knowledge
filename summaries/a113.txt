The Future of U.S. Economic Statecraft featuring former National Security Advisor General HR McMaster - Betting on America

Current State of U.S. Economic Security

• The U.S. has improved since 2017 but remains insufficient in addressing competitive challenges, particularly with China
• America was previously overconfident and complacent, vacating critical arenas of competition based on flawed post-Cold War assumptions
• The belief that China would liberalize economically and politically as it prospered proved incorrect
• The U.S. needs to "break into a dead sprint" to catch up in long-term competition

China's Economic Weaponization Strategy

• China has weaponized its statist mercantilist economic model through intellectual property theft, industrial espionage, and unfair subsidies
• Chinese practices include deliberate overproduction, dumping on international markets, and controlling critical supply chains for coercive purposes
• Forced technology transfers and market access promises have proven unreliable for Western companies
• The U.S. has been guilty of "serial gullibility" in dealing with China's economic aggression

Tools and Strategy for Economic Competition

• The U.S. possesses necessary tools but must recognize the competition's nature and re-enter vacated competitive spaces
• Private capital mobilization with government incentives is crucial, rather than replicating China's statist model
• Insurance policies and guaranteed purchase orders can protect investments against Chinese market dumping tactics
• A holistic approach integrating tariffs, investment screening, and export controls is needed

Alliance Strategy and Global South Engagement

• Current approach risks alienating allies through coercive measures that undermine encirclement strategies
• Effective competition requires coordination with Japan, Europe, and India to create alternatives to Chinese influence
• Many countries subjected to China's debt-trap diplomacy want alternatives and represent opportunities
• The U.S. should leverage its AI Action Plan and technology offerings to engage the Global South more effectively

Trade Policy Challenges and Opportunities

• Current tariff policies lack clear objectives and predictability, creating business uncertainty
• Focus on merchandise trade deficit is too narrow; services exports (including AI-enabled and digital services) should be emphasized
• Reciprocity principle is sound, but implementation has been chaotic with multiple conflicting objectives
• Financial services and technology sectors face unfair treatment abroad, particularly in Europe

Technology Competition and Innovation Ecosystems

• Ecosystem comparison (rather than capability snapshots) provides better insight into long-term competitive positioning
• U.S. advantages include academia-capital-entrepreneurship integration, particularly in Silicon Valley
• Strategy should focus on next-generation technologies rather than catching up in current Chinese-dominated sectors
• Advanced manufacturing, bioengineering, and small modular reactors represent areas for leapfrogging competition

Government Organization and Process Reform

• Current administration lacks effective National Economic Council (NEC) and National Security Council (NSC) coordination
• Purpose-driven approach needed: clear problem definition, objectives, assumption identification, and obstacle assessment
• Private sector expertise must be included at the table for effective strategy development
• Regular effectiveness measures and historical failure analysis are essential for avoiding repeated mistakes

Bipartisan Opportunities and Political Challenges

• Innovation, education reform, energy development, and manufacturing represent non-partisan agenda items
• Political party "tents" have shrunk, leaving many Americans without representation
• Leadership must practice "politics of addition" rather than appealing to narrow bases
• Focus on shared goals (better future for children, economic competitiveness) can bridge divides
