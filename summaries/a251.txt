Hetty Green (The Richest Woman in America)

Core Investment Philosophy and Methodology

• Green's primary strategy was contrary investing: buying when everyone wanted to sell and selling when everyone wanted to buy.
• She emphasized the "wisdom" of keeping substantial cash on hand to swoop in during panics and purchase high-quality assets at rock-bottom prices.
• Before any transaction, she performed intensive research, reading every available trade paper and report to understand the true worth of a company and cap her downside risk.
• She believed in "simple common sense" and advised reflecting on every bargain overnight before closing a deal.

Early Education and the "Duty" of Wealth

• Hetty began her business education at age two, eventually reading stock quotations to her grandfather and becoming her family's bookkeeper by age 13.
• Her father, Edward Robinson, taught her to "never owe anyone anything" and treated property as a trust to be enlarged rather than spent.
• She was raised with extreme frugality, learning to "watch the pennies" so the dollars would take care of themselves, a habit she maintained throughout her life.
• This training gave her a unique advantage, allowing her to flourish in a male-dominated financial world where very few women were taught to manage their own affairs.

Resilience During Financial Panics

• Green lived through numerous economic crises, including the panics of 1857, 1873, and 1907, using each as an opportunity to build her empire.
• While speculators who bought on margin were ruined during these crashes, Green remained robust because she and her family famously operated without debt.
• In the Panic of 1873, she acted as a "fearless Pitbull," buying railroad stocks and mortgage bonds when no one else was willing to buy.
• By converting real estate to cash before the Panic of 1907, she was left with massive liquidity to lend to the "solidest men" of Wall Street who came to her begging for funds.

Focus on Railroads and Real Estate

• Railroads and real estate were Green’s "circle of competence" because of their dynamic potential, unregulated operation, and untaxed profits.
• Her strategy for land was to "let the weeds grow" on unimproved property, which avoided taxes while the surrounding area’s development naturally increased her property's value.
• She insisted her son, Ned, learn the railroad business from the ground up—working as a section hand—before he could be trusted to manage it.
• Her deep knowledge of the "maze of lines" and constant study of shipping rates allowed her to outcompete mutual funds and male financiers.

Independence and Distrust of Social Norms

• Hetty refused the role of a Gilded Age socialite, choosing to work out of bank offices or on the floor rather than paying for a private space.
• She lived a nomadic life in boarding houses and flats to avoid establishing a residence for tax purposes and to evade public attention.
• She maintained a "steely" independence, often using fictitious names for property purchases to "move in silence" and protect her investment strategies.
• Green had deep disdain for the "idle rich" and "self-indulgent socialites," preferring authentic achievement and the company of common folk.

Mentorship and Advice for Future Generations

• She believed it was the duty of every woman to learn how to manage her own business affairs rather than relying on men.
• Green provided her son with a list of "don'ts," emphasizing fairness, avoiding envy, being charitable, and never kicking a man when he is down.
• She taught that focusing on one thing is essential for success, noting that "if you try to do too much, you can never get anywhere".
• At the end of her life, she viewed her work as her "amusement" and "duty," finding joy in being involved in the "great movements of the world".
