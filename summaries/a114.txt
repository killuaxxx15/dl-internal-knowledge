The World's Worst Bet: How America Gambled Dumbly on Globalization and Lost

The Globalization Gamble of the 1990s

• America made an unrecognized bet in the 1990s that it could enjoy all benefits of globalization without adequately addressing the costs or supporting those who would be displaced
• The end of the Cold War created euphoria and hubris, with the U.S. standing alone at the apex of global power, making free market expansion seem inevitable
• Economist Dani Rodrik at Harvard was one of the few prescient voices warning about globalization's distributional effects on developed economies
• Politicians promised assistance to displaced workers but consistently prioritized other issues like deficit reduction, wars, and financial crises

Winners and Losers of Global Integration

• Globalization lifted 1.5 billion people out of poverty globally and benefited college-educated Americans on the coasts
• Manufacturing workers and those with high school educations in America's heartland bore the brunt of job losses to global competition
• The promised "trickle-down" assistance from winners to losers never materialized, creating lasting resentment in affected communities
• Corporate supply chains were optimized purely for efficiency and cost, proving vulnerable during crises like the pandemic

Political Consequences and Trump's Rise

• Displaced workers grew increasingly disaffected with institutions after receiving no meaningful help from successive administrations
• Many Obama voters in places like Iowa flipped to Trump, seeing both as outsiders promising change from the established system
• Trump's appeal transcended traditional political categories - voters viewed "hope and change" and "make America great again" as similar anti-establishment messages
• The 2016 election was the first time voters had a clear choice on globalization issues, leading to Trump's victory

Current Trade Policy and Future Outlook

• Trump's tariffs have pushed average U.S. tariff rates to their highest levels since the 1930s, fundamentally altering global trade patterns
• These tariffs will inevitably cause price increases for American consumers, despite claims that foreign countries pay the costs
• Both parties offer backward-looking solutions - Trump focuses on tariffs, Biden emphasized industrial policy, but neither addresses future labor market disruptions
• The author advocates for active labor market policies, wage insurance, and place-based economic development strategies to help displaced workers transition to new opportunities
