A Memoir by the Cofounder of Microsoft

The Birth of Microsoft

• Paul Allen conceived the idea for Microsoft after seeing the Altair 8800 in Popular Electronics in 1974, recognizing that a microprocessor could run BASIC programming language.
• He and Bill Gates developed Altair BASIC in an intense two-month period in 1975, despite never having access to an actual Altair machine—they wrote the code blind and it worked on first try.
• Their initial ambition was modest: Gates predicted they might grow the company to 35 programmers, which seemed "really ambitious" at the time.

Partnership Dynamics with Bill Gates

• Allen positioned himself as "the idea man" who conceived innovations, while Gates challenged ideas and executed the best ones—a collaboration with natural tension that mostly worked productively.
• Gates was notoriously aggressive in business and demanding as a partner, at times belittling Allen's contributions and questioning his work ethic during intense periods.
• Despite professional conflicts, they remained lifelong friends—Gates was a regular, caring visitor when Allen faced Stage 4 lymphoma in 2009, demonstrating the complexity and endurance of their relationship.

Health Challenges and Life Decisions

• Allen was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma at age 29, which prompted his departure from Microsoft's daily operations—a decision that, in retrospect, allowed him to pursue broader passions while still earning billions.
• He faced multiple serious health issues throughout his life, including open-heart surgery, a pacemaker, and ultimately Stage 4 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2009, from which he eventually died at age 65.
• His early health scare made him realize his life had become "narrowly focused," leading him to travel and eventually rediscover that what he missed most was creating things.

Investment Wins and Misses

• Allen made a prescient $75 million profit investing in America Online in the early 1990s, buying 15% of the company when he believed the market underestimated its value.
• However, he sold his AOL stake due to disagreements with CEO Steve Case about broadband strategy—had he held until AOL's acquisition of Time Warner in 2000, his stake would have been worth $40 billion.
• This missed opportunity would have exceeded all the money he made from Microsoft, demonstrating how even billionaires experience massive financial regrets.

Life Philosophy and Legacy

• Allen's post-Microsoft life represented his true nature: driven by love of ideas and the urge to put them into motion, pursuing ventures in music, sports teams, space exploration, and various technologies.
• He rejected a one-dimensional existence, finding fulfillment in returning to the omnivorous curiosity of his youth—rockets, robots, music, chemistry—interests that were "deferred but not forgotten" during his Microsoft years.
• His wealth freed him to pick up passions seeded in his youth, and he considered his diverse "second act" over 27 years more fulfilling than Microsoft's success, despite the pride he felt in fundamentally changing how people work, play, and communicate.

Key Reflection on Purpose

• Allen's ultimate realization was that being motivated by recognition, money, or social goals wasn't his driver—he was motivated by the creative process itself, even with its risks and uncertainties.
• The experience of writing code that fundamentally changed the world gave him a sense of purpose he always wanted to recapture, though he found fulfillment through diverse creative pursuits rather than narrow focus.
