Conspiracy: Peter Thiel, Hulk Hogan, Gawker, and the Anatomy of Intrigue and Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future

The Nature of Conspiracy and Business Strategy

• Conspiracies and businesses share fundamental principles: both require determined, coordinated action in secret to disrupt the status quo and accomplish specific aims
• Peter Thiel's decade-long conspiracy to destroy Gawker through funding Hulk Hogan's lawsuit demonstrates that strategic patience, secrecy, and planning can overcome seemingly invincible opponents
• The conspiracy succeeded because it moved through three distinct phases: meticulous planning, disciplined execution, and managing the aftermath—requiring organizational thinking, recruiting, funding, and knowing when to stop
• Thiel's approach emphasized ruthless efficiency and hyper-competence versus Gawker's incompetent decision-making and arrogance about their invulnerability

The Contrarian Question and Definitive Vision

• Thiel's famous contrarian question—"What important truth do very few people agree with you on?"—forces people to think beyond consensus and convention
• A definitive view favors firm convictions over hedging bets: determine the one best thing to do and then do it, rather than pursuing many-sided mediocrity
• Extreme focus is essential—Thiel required everyone at PayPal to have exactly one priority, refusing to discuss anything else except that single initiative
• The greatest thing Steve Jobs designed was his business through careful planning and definitive multi-year plans, not by listening to focus groups or copying others' success

Creating Monopolies Through Secrets and Differentiation

• Competition is a destructive force, not a sign of value—under perfect competition, all profits get competed away, so the goal is to create a dynamic monopoly
• Great companies are built on open but unsuspected secrets about how the world works (like Airbnb seeing untapped supply where others saw nothing)
• Start small with a specific, valuable niche rather than trying to compete broadly—it's easier to reach a few thousand people who really need your product
• A business with a good definitive plan will always be underrated in a world where people see the future as random; durability matters more than short-term growth metrics

Agency and the Rejection of Randomness

• We live in a world where people don't think conspiracies (or starting businesses) are possible because they're skeptical of strong claims of human agency
• A startup is the largest endeavor over which you can have definitive mastery—agency not just over your own life, but over a small and important part of the world
• The essential trait of successful people is perseverance combined with a perverse expectation of difficulty, treating obstacles as information rather than barriers
• Founders only sell when they have no more concrete visions; definitive founders with robust plans don't sell because they see where they can take the company

The Power of Founders and Tolerance for Extremes

• The most important task in business—the creation of new value—cannot be reduced to a formula and applied by professionals
• Unique founders can make authoritative decisions, inspire strong personal loyalty, and plan decades ahead, unlike impersonal bureaucracies with short time horizons
• We need unusual individuals to lead companies beyond mere incrementalism; we should be more tolerant of founders who seem strange or extreme
• Jobs' return to Apple after professional CEOs nearly bankrupted it demonstrates that a founder's singular vision is often irreplaceable for creating breakthrough value

Lessons from Gawker's Downfall

• Gawker's fatal mistakes included underestimating their enemies, making unforced errors in depositions (joking about publishing child porn), and displaying massive hypocrisy between their stated values and actual practices
• Building a business around harming others and creating enemies is fundamentally unsustainable—Gawker failed to understand that actions have consequences and prodding people creates dangerous adversaries
• The difference in approach was stark: Thiel invested tens of thousands in research, jury consultants, and preparation while Gawker winged it, focusing on trivial matters like $75 million office leases
• Never interrupt an enemy making mistakes—let them talk themselves into overconfidence while you maintain discipline and secrecy
