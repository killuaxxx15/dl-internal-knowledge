A Blueprint for Canada's Future with Pierre Poilievre

Introduction and Personal Background

• Pierre Poilievre is the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada and the Official Opposition, who describes himself as someone who started from humble beginnings and was adopted by school teachers in Calgary.
• His wife came to Canada as a refugee from Venezuela, which has shaped his belief that Canada should be a country where "you can start anywhere and get anywhere."
• He rejects comparisons to Donald Trump, noting they don't share much in common - Poilievre comes from humble beginnings while Trump was born into wealth, and Poilievre considers himself "distinctively Canadian" in outlook and goals.
• Becoming a parent to two children (a 3-year-old son Cruz and a 6-year-old daughter Valentina who has special needs) has increased his empathy for families facing various challenges.
• Poilievre believes Canadians are currently more divided than ever, partially "by design" by the current government, and seeks to unite people around what he calls "the Canadian promise."

Economic Vision and Policy

• Poilievre criticizes the current economic approach, stating Canada's economy creates less value per worker than America's, with Canadians generating $53 USD per hour worked compared to Americans' $78 USD.
• He attributes this productivity gap to capital starvation, with Canada receiving only $15,000 of investment per worker annually versus $28,000 in the US, which he blames on high taxes and slow permitting processes.
• Poilievre proposes a "Canada First Reinvestment Tax Cut" offering zero capital gains tax when profits are reinvested in Canada to encourage domestic investment.
• He wants to streamline permitting processes across all levels of government to make Canada have "the fastest building permits in the world," reducing timeframes from years to months.
• Poilievre plans to create "shovel-ready zones" with pre-published environmental standards and permits to remove risk and uncertainty for investors.

Natural Resources and Energy Strategy

• Poilievre emphasizes the importance of natural resources as Canada's biggest export sector that pays "an enormous amount of tax" and creates high-paying jobs.
• He advocates unlocking Canada's resources (third most oil, fifth most gas, first in uranium and potash) to make Canada "the richest country in the world."
• Poilievre proposes building more pipelines to reduce dependency on the US market, noting that currently 100% of Canadian gas and 95% of oil goes to the United States.
• He supports expanding LNG (liquefied natural gas) facilities, highlighting that Canada could sell gas for $14 to Europeans instead of $4 to Americans, with advantages including colder weather (making liquefaction 25% cheaper) and shorter shipping times to Asia.
• Poilievre notes that enabling resource development would benefit First Nations communities through royalty revenue participation, potentially making coastal First Nations "literally the richest people in the world."

Government Spending and Fiscal Policy

• Poilievre plans to balance the budget by implementing a "hard dollar for dollar law" requiring any new spending to be matched with equal savings, similar to what was done under Bill Clinton in the US during the 1990s.
• He would reduce bureaucracy through attrition (not filling all 17,000 public service positions that open annually through retirement), cut back on consultants ($21 billion current spending), and reduce foreign aid.
• Poilievre argues that government growth beyond a basic social safety net transfers wealth from working class to the extremely rich, citing the doubling of consultant spending to $21 billion ($1,400 per Canadian family).
• He claims inflation from government money printing has "decimated the poor," with poverty increasing to 25% and food bank usage more than doubling.
• Poilievre commits to protecting the social safety net for the most vulnerable while cutting taxes on investment, energy, work, and home building.

US Tariffs and International Trade

• On US tariffs, Poilievre advocates for retaliation to create "deterrent value" but would propose putting tariffs "on ice" for 100-120 days while renegotiating CUSMA (Canada-US-Mexico Agreement).
• He would offer increased military spending and continental defense cooperation as negotiating points with the US, but structure commitments so they could be withdrawn if the US violated the agreement.
• Poilievre believes Trump's tariffs against Canada actually strengthen China by weakening both Canada and the US, and would argue that North Americans should cooperate against the Chinese threat.
• He supports reducing interprovincial trade barriers, offering to share increased federal revenues with provinces that eliminate protectionist measures.
• Poilievre states Canada needs to stand up against Chinese interference in politics and unfair trade practices while maintaining strong relations with the US as "our closest neighbor."

Housing and Opportunity

• Poilievre contrasts the past, when a construction worker could pay off a house in downtown Ottawa in seven years, with today when even educated professionals struggle to make down payments.
• He criticizes "obstructionism that blocks home building" as benefiting mansion owners while harming working class people and new immigrants.
• Poilievre plans to speed up permits for housing development and incentivize municipalities to accelerate approval processes.
• He wants to restore the "Canadian promise" where anyone who works hard, follows the law, and is decent "can have a beautiful life."
• Poilievre believes current government policies have been "actively tilting the scale against the least fortunate" rather than creating opportunity and upward mobility.

Crime and Public Safety

• Poilievre criticizes "liberal catch and release laws" that make it easy for repeat offenders to be released, citing Vancouver where police had to arrest the same 40 offenders 6,000 times.
• He plans to repeal Bill C-75 (the "liberal bail law"), eliminate house arrest for serious offenses, and implement a "three strikes throughout law" where three serious violent convictions result in permanent ineligibility for bail, parole, or house arrest.
• Poilievre proposes a minimum ten-year sentence for repeat violent offenders, with release only earned through "impeccable behavior, clean drug tests, and learning an employable skill."
• He plans to secure borders with more shipping container scanners and 2,000 additional CBSA officers.
• Poilievre connects addiction and crime, promising to treat 50,000 people suffering from addiction to "break that cycle" and bring peace back to Canadian streets.

Healthcare Reform

• Poilievre commits to preserving funding increases to the Canada Health Transfer while focusing on low-cost ways to expand physician and nurse availability.
• He notes 20,000 immigrant doctors and 32,000 immigrant nurses in Canada cannot practice due to licensing barriers rather than qualification issues.
• Poilievre proposes a national licensing test similar to what exists for trades, to quickly integrate foreign-trained medical professionals.
• He promises to protect the Canada Health Act and ensure no one is denied care due to inability to pay, maintaining universal healthcare as a "basic Canadian value."
• Poilievre wants to speed up drug approvals by recognizing treatments already working in other advanced jurisdictions.

Military and Defense Strategy

• Poilievre acknowledges the need to invest in AI, advanced robotics, aviation, and drone technology to modernize Canada's military.
• He emphasizes building up cyber defense capabilities to protect against attacks that could shut down power stations, scramble banking records, or disrupt government benefit systems.
• Poilievre sees opportunity in training military personnel with advanced technological skills that could later benefit the private sector, similar to Israel's "Startup Nation" approach.
• He believes Canada should aim to have "the most advanced cyber and high-tech warfare and defense capabilities anywhere in the world."
• Poilievre plans to increase defense spending as part of his negotiation strategy with the US regarding tariffs.

National Identity and Cultural Values

• Poilievre opposes identity politics that "divides people based on their group origins" and prefers treating everyone as individuals judged on "personal character and conduct."
• He believes newcomers should "bring their culture, language, food, traditions" but "problems from abroad have to stay at home" as "we're Canadian first, above all our other identities."
• Poilievre criticizes the current government for encouraging people to "divide into different camps," linking this to protests targeting Jewish institutions.
• He advocates celebrating Canadian successes and history, putting "heroes back in the passport," and building new statues rather than tearing down existing ones.
• Poilievre wants to change Canada's mentality from being "content to go for bronze" to "going for gold," including celebrating entrepreneurs as heroes.

Media and Free Speech

• Poilievre opposes Bill C-11 ("the censorship law") which gives powers to the CRTC to control content, and views the internet and social media as an opportunity rather than a threat.
• He believes government funding for media creates problems when "one politician is saying we shouldn't be offering as many subsidies to media and when one candidate is offering more subsidies."
• Poilievre supports free speech while acknowledging existing criminal code provisions against incitement to violence and genocide.
• He argues that recent toxic ideologies and hate speech are more a "top down phenomenon" from institutions than a "bottom up" result of free speech online.
• On AI regulation, Poilievre supports banning "unapproved use of other people's images in intimate acts" and protecting children from online luring, while ensuring transparency in government rules imposed on AI companies.

Climate Change Approach

• Poilievre warns against "carbon leakage" where high taxes drive production to more polluting jurisdictions, increasing global emissions while decreasing Canadian output.
• He cites the example of Manatec tomatoes paying carbon tax on CO2 released into greenhouses (though absorbed by plants), making Mexican imports cheaper despite their transportation emissions.
• Poilievre proposes tax breaks for companies producing goods below emission levels, noting Canadian aluminum production generates 2 tons of carbon per ton of aluminum versus China's 14 tons.
• He believes repatriating production to Canada from higher-emitting countries would simultaneously enrich the economy and reduce global emissions.
• Poilievre frames his approach as cutting taxes on low-emitting Canadian industries to "bring the production home and bring emissions down at the same time."

Personal Reflection and Vision for Canada

• Poilievre acknowledges that his passion for helping suffering Canadians sometimes comes across as aggressive, but "it comes from a place of caring for the people that I'm fighting for."
• He wants to convert that care into showing people his positive vision for the country, so people vote "not because they're angry, but because they're hopeful."
• His vision of success for Canada in four years is a place where every child grows up knowing they can achieve anything they want with hard work.
• Poilievre defines the "Canadian promise" as restoring hope and opportunity where anyone who "puts in a good day's work and strives hard and follows the law and is honest and decent can have a beautiful life."
• He ultimately wants to create a country where parents can tell their children they can achieve any dream, from becoming an astronaut to starting a business to curing cancer, through hard work.
