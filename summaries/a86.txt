Rathin Roy on How India Slices the Fiscal Pie

India's Unique Federal Structure

• India is constitutionally a "union of states" rather than a federation - the central government can create, alter, or dissolve states, but once created, states have constitutional powers similar to federal units
• Major taxes (income, corporate, GST) are collected centrally and distributed to states through the Finance Commission, which determines the vertical split (currently 42% center, 58% states) and horizontal distribution formula
• The Finance Commission appears every five years to recommend tax sharing formulas and then dissolves immediately after submitting its report, with no ability to monitor implementation

Post-Liberalization Transformation to Compensatory State

• Since 1991, India's total government size has remained constant at ~25% of GDP, but the center has shrunk while states have expanded their fiscal footprint
• The central government shifted from being an investor in development to primarily financing consumption expenditure - by 2005, 72 paise of every borrowed rupee went to consumption rather than investment
• India became a "compensatory state" after 1995, providing welfare to compensate for development failures rather than creating prosperity - exemplified by 800 million people requiring food subsidies despite India having minimal extreme poverty

Geographic Divergence and Fiscal Tensions

• Economic growth post-liberalization was highly uneven, concentrated in services and in southern/western states, creating a stark prosperity divide with northern states
• Poorer states like Bihar and UP receive disproportionate fiscal transfers through the income distance formula, while prosperous states generate most tax revenue but receive less back
• Southern states question why after 60 years of redistributive transfers, recipient states remain poor, creating political tensions around fiscal federalism

GST Implementation Failures

• Originally conceived as a simple, low-rate unified tax (9-11%), GST became a complex system with 7 non-zero rates and 50+ cesses due to bureaucratic insistence on "revenue neutrality"
• The GST Council has trivialized taxation by creating different rates for minute product distinctions (e.g., barfi vs chocolate barfi), with over 600 rate changes since 2017
• Organized, oligopolistic sectors successfully lobby for lower rates while small, dispersed producers face higher rates, making the system both regressive and economically distorting

Absence of Prosperity Vision

• India lacks a coherent theory of prosperity - instead of enabling citizens to afford basic needs (food, clothing, housing, education, healthcare) through market income, the state provides compensatory subsidies
• Even prosperous southern states maintain low-productivity informal economies (symbolized by 10-rupee tea) rather than transitioning to higher productivity despite having Indonesia-level per capita incomes
• Only 7% of Indians earn enough to pay income tax, with even entry-level government officers and university professors falling below the tax threshold

Migration and Social Integration Challenges

• Internal migration from poor to rich states could solve fiscal imbalances, but migrants work in low-end occupations without family integration or social acceptance
• Unlike Brahmins and Baniyas who form national communities, lower-caste migrants don't intermarry across regions or become culturally integrated in destination states
• The lack of portable benefits and local government capacity to absorb migrants prevents the economic and social integration needed for sustainable internal migration

Future Pathways and Risks

• Three potential solutions exist: massive migration from north to south (blocked by social barriers), southern states growing fast enough to subsidize the north indefinitely (unsustainable), or risk of union fragmentation
• India needs a national conversation on prosperity that moves beyond ethnic and caste identities to economic categories (farmers, workers, consumers) that can unite across regions
• Without addressing the fundamental prosperity deficit and creating genuine economic opportunities, India will remain trapped in compensatory politics that undermines both fiscal sustainability and national unity
