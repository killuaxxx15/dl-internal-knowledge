Peter Cundill

A Life Documented: The 40-Year Journal

• At age 25, Cundill began a daily journal he kept for over 40 years — the primary source material for this biography, written in intimate, self-critical, and confessional detail.
• The journals served as both an emotional outlet and an intellectual commonplace book, capturing his investment thinking, relationships, depression, and hunger for self-mastery.
• His driving conviction from youth: "To achieve real greatness, a person needs above all passion, immense discipline, concentration, patience, and an unshakable determination to master his craft."
• He envisioned writing the journal as anticipating his own biography — a deliberate act of self-observation and accountability stretching across his entire life.

The Making of a Value Investor: Discovering Graham & Dodd

• Cundill spent years searching for an investment philosophy before his eureka moment in 1973, reading about Benjamin Graham's margin of safety concept and writing in all caps: "THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO DO FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE."
• He built a proprietary "net-net sheet" based on Graham and Dodd, refining current asset valuation into a repeatable framework his team used to track hundreds of companies internationally — by hand, pre-computers.
• His core rules: invest with a margin of safety, think contrarian, be patient, accept losses decisively without self-flagellation, and never wait for consensus before acting on a conviction.
• Over 25 years managing his fund, he averaged approximately 17% compound annual returns with only ~2 down years, later selling his firm (Peter Cundill & Associates) to Mackenzie.

Routine, Excellence, and the Body-Mind Connection

• Cundill maintained near-obsessive physical fitness his entire life — targeting sub-10% body fat, running marathons annually, and cycling — because he believed physical condition directly determined mental sharpness and curiosity.
• Inspired by Plato and Aristotle, he internalized: "Excellence is not an act but a habit" — fitness was inseparable from professional performance.
• His life philosophy, "Pete's Tips for Good Life," balanced contradictions: discipline and hedonism, stoicism and passion, routine and deliberate experiences of fear and adventure.
• He consciously preserved at least 80% of his professional time for investment research, refusing to become an administrator — identifying and avoiding a trap he watched derail other fund managers.

The Inner Life: Depression, Ambition, and Contradiction

• Despite his public image of supreme confidence, Cundill battled deep depression, came close to suicide at least once, and openly struggled with ambition he feared could corrupt him.
• He created two inner personas — optimistic "Frank" (named after his father) and darker "Pete" — using them to debate decisions, with a "realist arbitrator" moderating between them.
• He was emotionally complex in relationships: deeply reluctant to marry, engaged in affairs throughout his 25-year marriage, yet genuinely devoted to his wife Joanie in his own unconventional way.
• His personal philosophy embraced contradiction as a feature: "Be a warrior, be a priest, be a monk, be a hedonist... stasis is frightening."

Grief and Decline: Joanie's Death and the Onset of Illness

• His wife Joanie (Jay) was diagnosed with cancer and given 9–12 months to live; Cundill continued traveling globally and maintaining affairs, yet held her hand for 5 hours as she died — revealing the paradox at his core.
• Around the same time, a rare genetic neurological condition (Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, resembling Parkinson's but less treatable) had been slowly progressing, dismissed for years by doctors as benign tremor.
• As the disease advanced, he became physically devastated — losing balance, strength, and eventually the ability to walk, feed himself, or speak clearly — yet refused a wheelchair as long as possible.
• His final years were a determined effort to keep living fully: 30 theater visits, travel to Egypt and Bermuda, and writing this book with his friend and biographer Chris Risso-Gill.

A Life Without Regret: The Rare Achievement of "I Had a Wonderful Life"

• In his final months, largely incapacitated, Cundill relived his life through his journals with Chris — and the process enabled him to say, with conviction, "I had a wonderful life."
• His last public advice encapsulated a lifetime of practice: "The mantra is patience, patience, and more patience. Think long term — the big rewards accrue with compound annual rates of return."
• A companion's account of his final Bermuda trip captured his indomitable spirit — falling in pools, nearly choking at dinner, laughing through near-fatal mishaps — still flirting, still demanding, still fully himself.
• The author frames Cundill's greatest achievement not as his investment returns, but his courage and humor in facing a devastating, humiliating death entirely without self-pity.
