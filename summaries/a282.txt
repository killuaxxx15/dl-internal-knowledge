Walter Chrysler

Frontier Childhood and Family Values

• Chrysler grew up in 1870s Kansas railroad towns with hardworking parents who taught self-sufficiency and perseverance in harsh frontier conditions where families ate buffalo meat and endured extreme weather.
• His mother possessed prodigious energy and ruled the household with constant work, while his father was a gentle Union Pacific locomotive engineer who reasoned rather than punished.
• The family built their own home, created their own plumbing systems, and never spent money on anything they could make or get themselves, instilling deep resourcefulness.

Early Career Development and Work Ethic

• Chrysler started working at age 14 for $10 monthly as a delivery boy with 16-hour days, but quit because he wanted to learn machinery instead of working retail.
• He became a machinist apprentice, making his own tools due to poverty, which he later believed was valuable because custom tools guaranteed proper function.
• His father's railroad work profoundly influenced him—watching his father operate locomotives left young Walter's face "tired from grinning in hours of ecstasy."

Rise Through the Railroad Industry

• Chrysler worked his way up through various railroad positions, learning every aspect of locomotive mechanics and management while moving between different companies.
• He demonstrated exceptional mechanical aptitude and leadership, eventually becoming works manager at American Locomotive Company at age 37 earning $12,000 annually.
• His hands-on approach and deep technical knowledge made him invaluable, as he could solve problems other managers couldn't because he understood the machinery intimately.

Transition to Automotive Industry

• In 1911 at age 36, Chrysler took a massive pay cut from $12,000 to $6,000 to join Buick because he was obsessed with automobiles and saw their future potential.
• Within four years at Buick, he became president and increased production dramatically while improving quality and worker conditions.
• He later joined Willys-Overland and then Maxwell Motor Company, where he would build his automotive empire despite starting with nearly bankrupt companies.

Creating the Chrysler Corporation

• When barred from the 1924 New York Auto Show for not having produced cars yet, Chrysler rented the Hotel Commodore lobby and "stole the show," generating massive excitement.
• The Chrysler car launched successfully in 1924, selling 32,000 units in the first year and generating $4.1 million profit after starting with $5 million in debt.
• In 1928, he purchased Dodge Brothers for $160 million despite critics calling it "buying a lemon"—a decision he later vindicated as one of the soundest of his life, helping Chrysler Corporation emerge from the Depression debt-free.

Legacy and Philosophy

• Chrysler built the 77-story Chrysler Building for his sons, instructing them to start "in the basement" cleaning floors to understand every job before managing—the same path he followed.
• Late in life, he frequently shed tears not from self-pity but from gratitude for American opportunities that allowed a poor boy riding freight trains to achieve massive success.
• He wrote his autobiography hoping to inspire "other lonely boys roving in the land to keep on trying," emphasizing that hard work, continuous learning, and persistence could overcome any obstacle.
