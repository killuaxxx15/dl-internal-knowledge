Steve Jobs (the bizarro years of Steve Jobs)

NeXT's Massive Financial Failure

• NeXT burned through over $250 million in capital and royalties over eight years without producing a single penny of net profit, making it potentially the most expensive entrepreneurial flop in history at that time.
• The company engaged in accounting manipulation, claiming their first "profitable quarter" by excluding legitimate expenses like interest payments on loans, while hiding a $40 million annual loss.
• Jobs was skilled at manipulating press coverage and public perception, encouraging reporters to forget NeXT's actual founding date to minimize attention on years of failure and keep focus on an always-promising future.
• The company's management was so persuasive in denying problems that they fooled not only the public but also themselves, creating internal delusion about their actual business performance.

Strategic Blunders and Market Misjudgment

• NeXT took three years from founding to launch their first product, operating like "The Wizard of Oz" by carefully controlling what information the public could see.
• The company lurched from one failed strategy to another, repeatedly missing market opportunities and making fundamental business misjudgments about what customers actually wanted.
• Jobs convinced investors and talented professionals to sink careers, money, and prestige into the venture based on his reputation from Apple, despite mounting evidence of failure.
• The book (published in 1993) ends with NeXT being forced to abandon hardware manufacturing entirely and focus solely on the NeXTSTEP operating system, a pivot that wasn't even Jobs' choice.

The Eventual Redemption Through Apple Acquisition

• Despite years of failure, Jobs managed to convince Apple CEO Gil Amelio to purchase NeXT for $450 million in 1997, four years after the book's publication.
• This acquisition led to Jobs returning to Apple and eventually running the company again within a year, turning what appeared to be a complete disaster into an unexpected pathway back to success.
• The story demonstrates that even catastrophic business failures can have unexpected redemptive endings when circumstances and timing align, though this outcome was far from certain during NeXT's operation.

Key Lessons on What Not to Do

• The book serves primarily as a cautionary tale, teaching readers what not to do in business by examining Jobs' failed decisions and strategies at NeXT.
• It contrasts sharply with the success story of Apple's early years, showing what happens when you build a product nobody wants versus a revolutionary product people embrace.
• The author emphasizes how believing in your own manufactured narratives and accounting tricks can be more dangerous than external deception, as it prevents necessary course corrections.

The Gullibility of Others

• A significant portion of NeXT's investment capital came from other people's pockets rather than Jobs' own money, highlighting his ability to leverage his reputation despite mounting failures.
• Many investors, employees, and partners lent money, careers, and prestige to Jobs' quest based largely on his past Apple success rather than NeXT's actual performance.
• The story illustrates how a powerful personal brand and reality distortion field can sustain a failing venture far longer than fundamentals would typically allow.

Recommended Reading Order for Jobs Biography Study

• The podcaster recommends reading Jobs biographies chronologically by time period covered rather than publication date for better understanding of his evolution.
• Start with "Return to the Little Kingdom" covering Apple's successful early years, then "The NeXT Big Thing" covering the failure years, followed by comprehensive biographies like Isaacson's "Steve Jobs" and "Becoming Steve Jobs."
• This approach provides contrasting lessons: first understanding what happens with a revolutionary successful product (Apple II), then studying what happens when building products nobody wants (NeXT computer).
