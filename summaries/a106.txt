Trump's India Tariff Tirade: A Gift to Beijing? With Evan Feigenbaum

Trump's Tariff War with India

• Trump imposed an additional 25% tariff on most Indian goods in August 2025, effectively doubling duties and targeting India for continued Russian oil purchases
• The tariffs appear inconsistent and arbitrary - India faces higher rates (50% total) than Pakistan (19%) or Vietnam (20%), despite China purchasing more Russian oil
• Previous Biden administration officials actually encouraged India's Russian oil purchases for global market stability, making the policy reversal appear hypocritical
• The approach lacks strategic logic, targeting countries with both trade deficits and surpluses, with and without free trade agreements

Unraveling of 25-Year US-India Partnership

• The relationship had overcome major Cold War obstacles, nuclear sanctions, and built substantial trust through the 2008 civil nuclear deal and bipartisan support
• Three key foundations enabled past cooperation: willingness to take political risks, compartmentalizing third-party relationships, and depoliticizing the partnership
• Trump's actions have re-politicized the relationship, with Indian opposition and media viewing US behavior as targeting India unfairly
• Historical memories of US sanctions (particularly after India's 1974 nuclear test) are being reactivated, undermining decades of trust-building

Domestic Political Drivers

• US domestic politics increasingly target issues directly affecting India: H-1B visas, immigration policy, and manufacturing offshoring
• Trump's base includes anti-Indian sentiment, creating synergy between MAGA priorities and policies that harm US-India relations
• In India, the tariffs are seen as coercive and hypocritical, with domestic pressure on Modi's government not to appear weak
• The relationship has lost its bipartisan "depoliticized" status in both countries, making it vulnerable to political shifts

China's Strategic Opportunity

• Beijing is capitalizing on US-India tensions through renewed diplomatic engagement, including Wang Yi's visit to New Delhi and Modi's planned China visit
• Key deliverables include resuming direct flights and India's acceptance of China's preferred approach to border management (not letting disputes block other cooperation)
• However, fundamental mistrust remains due to border conflicts, India's massive trade deficit with China, and structural economic competition
• China faces limits due to India's post-2020 restrictions on Chinese investment, apps, and business operations following the Galwan clash

Regional and Strategic Implications

• The Quad alliance appears weakened as Trump's anti-India stance contradicts stated Indo-Pacific strategy goals
• India maintains strategic interest in balancing China but faces limits in deeper regional economic integration
• Russia relationship remains separate from China ties - India views Russia as important for preventing Russia-China coordination against Indian interests
• Plurilateral groups like BRICS and SCO remain largely "form chasing function" without meaningful operational content

Path Forward and Warning Signs

• A tariff deal is likely but won't restore lost trust, and Trump's tendency to renegotiate agreements creates ongoing uncertainty
• Key circuit breakers needed: functional Modi-Trump relationship, removing the issue from domestic politics, and bureaucratic continuity
• Early warning signs of irreversible damage include further politicization and elimination of institutional ballast that survived past tensions
• The relationship may remain largely frozen at strategic levels until potential change in US leadership
