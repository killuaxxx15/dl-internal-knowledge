South Korea Enters a Post-Election Bull Market

Election Results and Political Transition

• Lee Jae-myung won South Korea's presidential election, ending six months of uncertainty following the martial law debacle and impeachment of former President Yoon Suk-yeol
• The election had near-historical high turnout, signaling strong public engagement during this critical period
• The new left-wing government now has Legislative Assembly support, enabling more proactive legislation and policy implementation
• Markets responded positively with the KOSPI rising toward bull market territory and up over 17% year-to-date, making it one of the world's best-performing indices
• Foreign investors turned net buyers after the election results, ending nine consecutive months of net selling totaling almost $30 billion

Economic Challenges and Growth Priorities

• South Korea's central bank guided for 0.8% GDP growth, marking the first time outside of an official crisis that growth will fall below 1%
• President Lee declared economic growth as his top priority immediately after election results, reflecting public awareness of Korea's "silent crisis"
• The country faces multiple structural challenges including plummeting birth rates, rapidly aging population, and loss of export competitiveness to China
• The previous government's policy paralysis contributed to economic weakness, with the martial law incident highlighting desperation from stonewalled initiatives
• Korea's export-reliant economy faces threats from potential U.S. tariffs and uncertain global trade environment

China Competition and Export Competitiveness

• China has transformed from Korea's customer to competitor in just 5-7 years, eating market share in mid-segment volume products similar to how Korea previously displaced Japan
• Korean exporters are losing competitiveness across multiple sectors, with China surpassing Korea in areas where Korea was previously ahead
• Samsung Electronics faces unprecedented challenges, still unable to get qualification from Nvidia despite historically being a generation ahead in chip making
• The emergence of Chinese technology companies has made Koreans aware they are no longer comfortably ahead, with China having surpassed Korea in certain areas
• Next-generation sectors like EV batteries face uncertain policy environments and supply chain challenges

Policy Expectations and Market Implications

• The new left-wing government is expected to be more pro-business than the previous Moon administration due to changed economic circumstances and urgency of growth needs
• Fiscal stimulus packages, previously blocked before martial law, now have a clear runway for implementation as an "easy win"
• AI is among the top three policy agendas for economic transformation, though experts remain somewhat skeptical about translating technology into immediate economic growth
• Labor market flexibility and productivity improvements are crucial for export competitiveness, potentially requiring the left-wing party to contradict traditional positions on job security
• Domestic sectors are expected to outperform exports given uncertainty around tariff policies and global trade tensions

Corporate Governance and Capital Market Reforms

• The Value Up program, initiated by the previous right-wing government and modeled after Japan's success, aims to improve returns on capital rather than traditional export-driven growth
• The left-wing party's Korea Booster program focuses on empowering minority shareholders and establishing fiduciary duty of board directors to all shareholders
• Corporate governance reform combining both initiatives is expected to attract foreign investors back to Korean markets
• The program addresses urgent needs from plummeting birth rates and aging population requiring better returns on financial assets
• Foreign investors are expected to be encouraged by these corporate governance reforms

U.S.-Korea Relations and Geopolitical Considerations

• The relationship between U.S. and South Korea will be determined more by President Trump's policies than President Lee's, particularly regarding trade and tariffs
• Harder U.S. pressure on Korea through trade policies may give Korea room to hedge or shift towards China regardless of ruling party political affiliations
• Export-driven countries face challenges in building long-term strategies when tariff rates can swing from 10% to 150% based on changing U.S. policies
• The unpredictability of U.S. foreign policy, including potential renewed engagement with North Korea, creates uncertainty for traditional alliance relationships
• Korea's position as a supply chain nucleus makes it particularly vulnerable to global trade war impacts

Investment Strategy and Market Outlook

• Short covering among hedge funds is occurring following the lifting of the short sale ban, contributing to recent market bounces
• Foreign investors were caught off guard by Korea's outperformance year-to-date despite being net sellers throughout the period
• The $30 billion in foreign net selling represents significant potential upside if international investors return to Korean markets
• Momentum is considered crucial in Korean markets, with both businesses and traders following momentum-driven strategies
• Investment strategies must adapt to unprecedented global changes rather than relying on historical patterns, given the transformation of geopolitical and economic assumptions
