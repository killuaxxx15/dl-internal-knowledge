INVESTING WISELY IN AN UNCERTAIN WORLD W/ HOWARD MARKS

Early Career Formation and Risk Perspective

• Howard Marks was shaped by parents who lived through the Great Depression as adults, instilling deep risk aversion and caution through phrases like "save for a rainy day"
• His first job coincided with the Nifty 50 bubble (1968-1974), where investors believed there was "no price too high" for great companies
• The crash taught him fundamental lessons: "It's not what you buy, it's what you pay" and "good investing comes from buying things well, not buying good things"
• Moving from equity research to convertible bonds in 1978 positioned him perfectly for the birth of the high yield bond market with Michael Milken

Evolution from Value to Growth Thinking

• Conversations with his son Andrew during COVID lockdown challenged his traditional value investing approach
• Andrew pointed out that focusing solely on price discounts was limiting and that great companies deserve to be held for decades
• The memo "Something of Value" (January 2021) emphasized the need for open-mindedness and flexibility in a rapidly changing world
• Marks evolved from purely seeking "dollars for 50 cents" to understanding the value of quality compounders held long-term

Pattern Recognition and Market Timing

• Marks has successfully identified multiple bubbles by recognizing when investors dismiss valuation norms with "this time is different" thinking
• However, he acknowledges that sometimes things genuinely are different, requiring flexibility rather than blind adherence to historical patterns
• Currently views markets as rationally priced given low interest rates, recommending a slightly defensive but not extreme positioning
• Emphasizes that superior investing ultimately comes down to superior insight, which cannot be reduced to formulas

Investment Philosophy for Modern Markets

• The investment world has become much more efficient, making quantitative bargains harder to find
• Success now requires understanding non-quantitative information and having better insight into future developments
• Emotion remains the greatest enemy of successful investing, with most people buying high and selling low
• Recommends that amateur investors use funds and professional managers rather than attempting to pick individual securities

Perspectives on Current Opportunities

• Inflation Hedging: Recommends floating-rate bonds over fixed-rate, quality real estate with pricing power, and companies with profits growing faster than inflation
• Bitcoin/Crypto: Initially dismissive but now acknowledges he lacked sufficient knowledge to make informed judgments; emphasizes importance of intellectual humility
• China: Views it as an "economic adolescent" with the best decades ahead, despite current volatility and geopolitical concerns; believes 2% allocation is insufficient if China becomes the world's largest economy

Business Ethics and Life Philosophy

• Recently added "responsibility" to Oaktree's business principles, reflecting belief that corporations have duties beyond shareholder profits
• Partnership with Bruce Karsh has lasted 35+ years based on "shared values and complementary skills"
• Quotes Christopher Morley: "There is only one success: to be able to live your life your way"
• Emphasizes finding work that plays to your strengths while avoiding your weaknesses
