Warren Buffett (The Tao of Warren Buffett)

Focused Concentration on Exceptional Businesses

• Fortunes are typically built by identifying and focusing on one wonderful business with a durable competitive advantage rather than diversifying across dozens of companies.
• Buffett follows the principle of putting all "eggs in one basket" and watching that basket closely, a strategy he learned by studying business icons like Andrew Carnegie.
• When brilliant management tackles a business with poor fundamental economics, the poor reputation of the business—not the manager's brilliance—is what usually remains intact.
• Success involves looking for "one-foot bars" to step over—simple, high-probability opportunities—rather than attempting difficult "seven-foot" feats that require complex behavior.

The Power of Independent Thought and Judgment

• Buffett defines a "group decision" as looking in the mirror, emphasizing the necessity of thinking independently of the "herd".
• To think independently, one must do the work necessary to trust their own judgment and remain comfortable standing alone.
• Public opinion polls and market research are no substitute for original thought and the pride of creating a superior product.
• Writing is a critical exercise because it forces an individual to think deeply and get their thoughts straight before making decisions.

Managing Opportunity Costs and Sunk Costs

• The most important action to take when you find yourself in a "hole" is to stop digging and admit a mistake before you go broke.
• Energy is more productively spent changing to a new business vessel rather than devoted to patching leaks in a "chronically leaking boat".
• High opportunity costs mean that knowing when to call it quits on a non-promising venture is a highly valuable skill for both investors and entrepreneurs.
• It is vital to do all thinking and due diligence before signing a contract, as it is impossible to "un-sign" one later.

Discipline in Habits and Expense Management

• The "chains of habit" are often too light to be felt until they become too heavy to be broken, particularly regarding insidious business habits.
• Expenses compound negatively against a business just as interest compounds positively for an investment; therefore, any waste is significant.
• A great manager views cost-cutting as a default, permanent mode of operation—much like breathing—rather than a reactive program.
• Indiscipline in small matters is a strong indicator that an individual or business will be undisciplined in large matters as well.

Constant Self-Investment and Learning from History

• A person's main asset is themselves; they should care for their mind and body as if it were the only "car" they would ever own for a lifetime.
• Buffett and Munger emphasize learning from the experiences and mistakes of others through the extensive study of biographies.
• Failure to study history results in "ignorant amateurs" who repeat old mistakes during market bubbles because human nature does not change.
• Buffett credits Charlie Munger with providing the pivotal insight that shifted his strategy from buying "bargain" stocks to buying exceptional businesses.

Patience and the Requirement of Time for Value Growth

• Building significant business value takes time and cannot be rushed; as Buffett notes, "you can't produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant".
• Effective long-term strategies are built around things that do not change over time, such as customer desires for low prices and fast delivery.
• A great investor must wait for the "perfect pitch"—the right opportunity—and have the discipline to ignore bad or mediocre pitches.
• Successful growth is best achieved through organic "word-of-mouth" and compounding rather than requiring constant infusions of capital.
