Partition: The Creation of Pakistan (Part 3)

The India-Pakistan Border

• The partition created a 3,000-kilometer border from the Arabian Sea to the Himalayas, visible from space due to three layers of fencing, floodlights, thermal sensors, and landmines
• This border has made Indians and Pakistanis virtually inaccessible to each other, with meetings now easier in Britain than in the subcontinent itself
• The Wagah border ceremony, featuring elaborate military displays, was one of the few crossing points but remains closed following recent tensions
• Just 100 years ago, this border was entirely unforeseen and did not exist

Muhammad Ali Jinnah's Transformation

• Originally a secular, Westernized Gujarati barrister who drank whiskey, ate pork, and was described as one of the best-dressed men in the British Empire
• His marriage to 18-year-old Ruttie Petit, who was excommunicated by her Parsi community and later committed suicide, fundamentally changed and hardened him
• Initially opposed the idea of Pakistan, calling it a "Walt Disney dreamland," and advocated for Hindu-Muslim unity while criticizing Gandhi for bringing religion into politics
• The 1937 separation of Burma and Arabia from India directly inspired his demand for Muslim independence, with the term "Pakistan" coined by Cambridge student Rahmat Ali Chaudhry

Gandhi's Parallel Journey

• Like Jinnah, Gandhi was also a Gujarati lawyer whose wife's death profoundly affected him - Kasturba died in prison after Gandhi refused her penicillin treatment
• Following her death, Gandhi became emotionally unstable and began controversial brahmacharya experiments, sleeping next to naked women to test his celibacy
• His campaign for India to resemble the Hindu holy land of Bharat, use of Sanskrit terminology, and introduction of Hindu hymns as national anthem alienated Muslims
• The failure of negotiations with Jinnah after Kasturba's death led Gandhi to view the partition failure as personal defeat

The Bengal Famine's Role in Partition

• When Japan conquered Burma during WWII, Bengal was cut off from rice supplies, and transport systems were destroyed to create a front line
• The resulting famine primarily affected Muslim peasants, while Hindu landowners controlled most resources
• Hindutva leader Vinayak Savarkar called for Hindus to boycott government relief efforts, effectively condemning millions of Muslims to starvation
• This economic domination made the idea of Muslim freedom from Hindu control attractive in Bengal for the first time, contributing to partition sentiment

The Point of No Return: Direct Action Day

• August 16, 1946 was intended as a peaceful Gandhian-style strike to demonstrate Muslim support for Pakistan
• In Kolkata, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy organized a massive rally that turned violent, resulting in 4,000 confirmed deaths in what became known as the "Great Kolkata Killings"
• This was the first partition-related violence, spreading like wildfire across the country as survivors carried tales of horror to other regions
• The violence fractured relations between Congress and the Muslim League beyond repair, with even former allies like Sarojini Naidu calling Jinnah "Lucifer, the fallen angel"
