Investment Philosophy: Elimination Approach

• Uses systematic elimination process rather than stock picking - removes companies with 8 bad factors from index
• Eliminates based on: high leverage, expensive valuations, bad management, low growth, government customers, competitive industries
• Takes small initial positions (1.5-2%) rather than concentrated bets, allows positions to grow organically through performance
• Focuses on odds and probability rather than trying to predict winners - "you have to do odds like coin tossing"

Sector Focus and Global Perspective

• Believes only 3 sectors matter globally: Technology, Consumer, and Financial - everything else is "time pass"
• Splits allocation roughly 50% international (mainly US), 30% India, 10% gold, 5% cash, 5% private banking
• Made 8x returns on NVIDIA after reading "Chip War" book, emphasizes big picture macro thinking over micro analysis
• Invested in Chinese companies like Alibaba and CATL battery company based on dominant market positions at low valuations

Notable Investment Successes and Failures

• Alliance 95 fund delivered 280% returns in 1999, overall fund went up 11x when market was flat
• Early investments in HDFC Bank (1995), Zee TV, Infosys based on macro themes like private vs public sector
• Worst investment was Modi Luft (airline joint venture) but kept position size limited unlike competitors who had 24% weight
• Made 400x returns on Kotak Mahindra before it became a bank, bought at 50 million market cap

Life Philosophy and Market Psychology

• Advocates against retirement, believes it makes people boring and removes life's meaning
• Distinguishes between friends, acquaintances, and strangers - says only friends and strangers help, not acquaintances
• Learned from 2008 crisis that mood affects all stocks regardless of fundamentals - now keeps both bull and bear figurines in office
• Uses Twitter actively (590k followers) as outlet for thoughts, saves time compared to calling people individually
