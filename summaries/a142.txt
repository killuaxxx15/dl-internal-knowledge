The Long Tail - The Capital Cycle Podcast

Marathon's Capital Allocation Philosophy

• Marathon emphasizes evaluating how management allocates shareholder capital, citing Warren Buffett's observation that CEOs are responsible for deploying over 60% of business capital after 10 years
• Portfolio managers and analysts spend significant time meeting senior executives to understand their mental models, priorities, and long-term industry vision
• The goal is to understand how these leaders steward clients' capital to make better investment decisions

The Long Tail Concept and Business Strategy

• Chris Anderson's 2006 book "The Long Tail" argues companies historically focused on "hits" (mass appeal products), neglecting the profitable market for less popular items
• Three enabling forces: democratization of production (lower barriers), democratization of distribution (digital channels), and tools connecting supply and demand (algorithms, search engines)
• The concept remains relevant today, exemplified by companies like TikTok (video editing tools, infinite scroll, recommendation algorithms) and traditional businesses like Richelieu Hardware

Richelieu Hardware's Long Tail Implementation

• Canadian specialty hardware distributor selling 145,000 products from 109 distribution centers to small cabinet makers
• CEO obsessed with return on invested capital (ROIC), monitoring inventory turns on every single product and automatically adjusting prices to maintain uniform ROIC across all products
• Products selling less than twice annually are eliminated; faster-moving products get lower margins while slower items carry higher margins to ensure consistent capital returns

Competitive Position and Market Structure

• Richelieu holds 50-60% market share in Canada and 25% in served US markets, creating scale advantages in purchasing, logistics, and technology
• Operates in an ideal "hourglass" structure with fragmented suppliers and customers, reducing disintermediation risk
• Amazon risk mitigated by 50%+ own-label products, specialist sales reps, design showrooms, and customer training services

Investment Case and Cyclical Opportunity

• Share price currently weak due to temporary earnings depression from US residential housing downturn (75% of revenue from residential renovations)
• US existing home sales at 20-year lows (~4 million annually, 20% below 10-year average) due to high interest rates and homeowners locked into low mortgage rates
• Earnings per share halved since 2022 peak, but medium-term outlook positive as people inevitably move due to life changes, suggesting current earnings well below long-term potential
