Rare Steve Jobs Interview

Apple's Meteoric Rise and Jobs' Early Reputation

• Apple reached Fortune 500 status in just five years, faster than any company in history, growing from garage sales of $200,000 to $1.4 billion in 1984 revenue.
• Steve Jobs was worth approximately $450 million at the time, making him the youngest on Forbes’ list of richest Americans, one of only seven to do so entirely on their own.
• Despite wealth, Jobs avoided a lavish lifestyle, focusing on his mission to make computers as commonplace and impactful as kitchen appliances or telephones.
• At parties, Jobs preferred showing kids how to use Macs over mingling with celebrities, reflecting his focus on future generations’ engagement with technology.
• He famously explained his preference for teaching children with: “Older people ask, ‘What is it?’ but the boy asks, ‘What can I do with it?’”

Missionary vs Mercenary Founders

• Jobs’ disinterest in money highlighted a “missionary” mindset focused on creating valuable products over flipping stock.
• This concept parallels Jeff Bezos’ framework distinguishing “missionaries” (product- and customer-focused) from “mercenaries” (profit-driven), with Bezos noting missionaries often make more money.
• Jobs was described as an engaging pitch-man who never missed a chance to sell his vision.
• Selling, Jobs believed, was essential for founders: to customers, employees, and investors, underscoring that great founders are often great salespeople.
• He consistently placed his work in historical context, likening computers to transformative inventions like the telephone or combustion engine.

The Information Revolution Analogy

• Jobs described the computer revolution as equivalent to the petrochemical revolution, delivering “free intellectual energy” instead of mechanical energy.
• He argued the information revolution would dwarf the petrochemical one in societal impact, showcasing clear vision at age 29.
• Jobs viewed computers as humanity’s best tool, dedicating his life to developing them despite people’s limited understanding of them at the time.
• He stressed the computer’s potential to save hours of work while using minimal power, and challenged people to imagine its evolution over decades.
• This foresight was striking in an era when many struggled to grasp even basic computer concepts.

The Next Big Thing and Historical Context

• Jobs viewed the computer as a writing tool, communication center, calculator, planner, filer, and artistic instrument—all in one, limited only by software.
• He warned that while outcomes couldn’t be precisely predicted, the impact would be massive, much like the telephone’s unforeseen uses.
• Comparing the telegraph and telephone, Jobs highlighted usability as critical: the telephone succeeded because everyone already knew how to talk and listen.
• He insisted Apple’s mission was to take personal computing from the “telegraph stage” to the “telephone stage,” prioritizing simplicity and accessibility.
• His mantra of “turn it on and it just works” reflected his obsession with eliminating complexity for customers.

Simplicity and Product Philosophy

• Jobs criticized complex software like WordStar, noting its 400-page manual as evidence of poor design.
• He believed good PR was about educating people, not deception, echoing lessons from Sony founder Akio Morita and Polaroid’s Edwin Land.
• Ad campaigns, to Jobs, were necessary for competition and educating customers about superior products.
• He argued that great marketing simply communicated a product’s inherent value, reinforcing his commitment to product excellence.
• He emphasized that you can’t con customers because ultimately “the products speak for themselves.”

Building Insanely Great Products

• Jobs believed making great products required challenging entrenched thinking and rejecting rigid mental patterns.
• He highlighted the importance of constantly asking if things could work better, similar to inventor James Dyson’s approach.
• He warned that as companies grow, they risk losing vision, creativity, and the willingness to support new ideas due to bureaucratic layers.
• Apple, he said, was built by “troublemakers” who were talented individual contributors often rejected elsewhere.
• He cited Edwin Land as a role model who saw the intersection of art, science, and business, and who inspired Apple’s emphasis on fostering creativity.

Maintaining a Mission-Driven Culture

• Jobs stressed the need for companies to attract people willing to take risks and make a “dent in the universe,” cultivating a mission bigger than any one individual or even the company itself.
• He reflected on the collective contribution of society—from language to technology—and the rare chance to add something meaningful back.
• He believed Apple was in a moment of shaping the future, giving employees the chance to do something significant together.
• Addressing competition, he positioned Apple as missionaries serving people, contrasting IBM’s profit-focused, “number cruncher” mentality.
• He rejected the notion of a single computer standard, arguing it would stifle innovation much like enforcing one automobile standard in the 1920s would have.

Competing with IBM and Industry Strategy

• Jobs envisioned Apple serving the “Fortune 14 million” small businesses, not just the Fortune 500 where IBM was strong.
• He argued that computers should become household appliances for tens of millions of people.
• Despite being critical of IBM’s approach, Jobs acknowledged the scale of the industry might limit new entrants—but ironically overlooked contemporaries like Dell.
• He stressed making the Macintosh great was their “last chance to make a clean break” and shape industry direction.
• Jobs believed the market would demand computers regardless of quality, urging designers to create beautiful, easy-to-use machines.

Formative Early Experiences

• Jobs credited his father, a machinist with exceptional mechanical skills, for nurturing his curiosity by letting him disassemble and reassemble things.
• Growing up in Palo Alto put him at the heart of Silicon Valley’s innovation ecosystem, influenced by pioneers like Hewlett and Packard and the spread of transistor technology.
• Early exposure at Hewlett-Packard included Tuesday night sessions using their computers, sparking his fascination at age 12.
• He famously cold-called Bill Hewlett for parts, which led to a summer job assembling frequency counters—demonstrating his willingness to ask for help.
• This openness to asking for help remained a defining trait, which Jobs considered essential for turning dreams into reality.

Partnership with Wozniak and Apple’s Birth

• Jobs met Steve Wozniak, a gifted engineer who introduced him to the Homebrew Computer Club, where hobbyists shared ideas and built their own machines.
• Witnessing the Altair kit’s success inspired the idea that anyone could own a computer—a transformative realization.
• Wozniak built what became the Apple I by hooking up a microprocessor to a terminal; together, they sold around 150 units.
• The first Apple sales made around $95,000, marking the shift from hobby to business.
• Jobs’ later reflection emphasized that no one, including himself, could have predicted Apple’s massive growth.

Apple’s Growth Trajectory

• From $200,000 in garage sales in 1976, Apple’s revenue exploded: $7 million (1977), $17 million (1978), $47 million (1979), $117 million (1980), $335 million (1981), $583 million (1982), $985 million (1983), and projected $1.5 billion (1984).
• Jobs remained humble about this trajectory, admitting he never imagined selling a million computers annually.
• He described Apple’s early years as ten lifetimes worth of intense challenges, learning, and human experience.
• Reflecting on his impending 30th birthday, Jobs quoted an old saying: “For the first 30 years of your life, you make your habits. For the last 30 years of your life, your habits make you.”
• He hoped Apple would remain a thread running through his life, even if there were periods of separation.

Vision for Computing’s Future

• Jobs envisioned the shift from computers as obedient servants to intuitive guides or agents, anticipating users’ needs and automating responses.
• He acknowledged Apple’s challenge in recognizing and supporting revolutionary ideas, even from outsiders.
• He recognized the need for the company to stay open to “small and fragile ideas” despite its size and success.
• His comments reflected an acute awareness of the difficulty established companies have in maintaining innovation.
• Jobs ended with humility about not knowing exactly what he wanted for the rest of his life but expressing hope that his journey and Apple’s would continue to intertwine.
