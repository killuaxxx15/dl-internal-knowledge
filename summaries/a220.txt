Henry Ford (Today and Tomorrow)

The Wage Motive and Purchasing Power

• Ford argues that high wages and low prices are essential because employees are also customers; underpaying them reduces the demand required to sustain work.
• True prosperity requires sharing success with those who create it, as cutting wages ultimately limits the number of available customers and stifles the market.
• Management must keep costs low and wages high to prevent destroying the business, rejecting the notion that wages are merely an expense to be minimized.
• The goal is to increase buying power, as high wages combined with high prices simply result in inflation rather than genuine economic benefit.

Service as the Sole Purpose of Business

• A corporation must be designed primarily to furnish a service to the community, with the organization following the service rather than the service following the corporation.
• While profit is necessary for survival, a business run solely for profit without regard for service has no reason to exist and will eventually die.
• The true test of a corporation is how far its benefits are passed on to the consumer, making the customer the priority over short-term financial gains.
• The ultimate goal of industry is to liberate people from the drudgery of existence by filling the world with well-made, low-priced products.

The Primacy of Objective and Focus

• Ford maintained a fanatical focus on a single objective—manufacturing motors—refusing to build, buy, or make anything that did not center around this specific goal.
• Business owners must first determine their objective, as methods should be shaped by the purpose rather than allowing methods to dictate the business's direction.
• Research and expansion were strictly limited to activities that directly supported the single objective, avoiding the distraction of wandering into unrelated fields.
• Success comes from faithfully trying to serve and doing one thing well, which eliminates the need to worry about competition.

Eliminating Waste and Valuing Time

• Waste is described as a crime against society, with the waste of time being the hardest to correct because it cannot be salvaged like material scrap.
• Time should be viewed as human energy; proper planning and design prevent waste before it happens, which is a higher achievement than fixing issues later.
• Ford believed in "getting something from nothing" by using fewer resources, such as reducing lumber usage even while production numbers increased.
• Inefficiencies, such as hiring two men for a one-man job or slow delivery times, are considered forms of grand larceny against the public.

Continuous Improvement and Experimentation

• Past achievements are only for learning; a business must not rely on tradition but should view all established methods as experiments to be improved upon.
• There is no "best way" that lasts forever, as today’s standards will inevitably be superseded by tomorrow’s improvements.
• Ford preferred directing operations with people who had no previous knowledge of the subject, as they were not limited by knowing what was considered "impossible" by experts.
• The organization actively sought to abolish established procedures, like central toolrooms, if they caused delays, proving that even successful systems must evolve.


The Infinite Nature of Opportunity

• Ford rejected the idea of a lack of opportunity, arguing that every new idea put into practice creates multiple new opportunities for others.
• The world is not a zero-sum game; industrial advances open creative doors, and a single idea can employ millions directly and indirectly.
• Technology and invention do not lead to a lack of work but rather generate new needs and services for future generations to pursue.
• Poverty can be banished by providing a living for all who will work, provided that old, outworn notions are discarded in favor of tested new ideas.
