Sol Price (Costco)

The Mentorship Legacy That Shaped Modern Retail

• Sol Price directly influenced retail giants Jim Sinegal (Costco), Sam Walton (Walmart), and Bernard Marcus (Home Depot), who all credit him as their primary business mentor and source of innovation.
• Jim Sinegal worked at FedMart starting in 1954 and later founded Costco in 1983 using Sol's core principles, eventually merging with Price Club in 1993.
• Sol's teaching philosophy emphasized strong operating efficiencies, passing savings to customers, and the principle that business is about more than making money—it has an obligation to serve society.

From Misfit to Overachiever: Early Drive and Character

• Sol compensated for a physical deformity (drooping eyelid) and childhood teasing by becoming an exceptional student, skipping two grades and excelling without trying hard.
• His teacher warned his mother he could become either "a gangster or someone who would do much good," exhibiting the rebellious spirit common in entrepreneurs who challenge existing systems.
• As a first-generation American whose parents were unskilled laborers, Sol exceeded expectations by becoming an attorney and eventually founding and taking three separate companies public.

Revolutionary Retail Concepts: FedMart and Price Club

• Sol pioneered the warehouse club concept with Price Club, which became the model for numerous competitors and fundamentally changed retail—he quipped he "should have worn a condom" when called the father of an industry.
• Sam Walton admitted borrowing FedMart innovations for Walmart in 1962, then returned 20 years later to study Price Club before launching Sam's Club in 1983.
• Bernard Marcus visited Price Club in 1978, and Sol suggested he open a home improvement business using the warehouse format—leading directly to Home Depot's founding in 1979.

Core Business Philosophy: Intelligence and Moral Courage

• Sol believed in doing what was right even against traditional opposition, emphasizing that "courage to stick to your guns when swimming against the current" was essential to business leadership.
• He demanded complete honesty from his team, expecting to be "fully informed openly and honestly, even if he did not like what he heard," creating a culture of transparency.
• His philosophy that compliments should be rare but meaningful was so consistent that Jim Sinegal waited "50 fucking years" for acknowledgment—showing Sol's high standards and the weight of his approval.

Strategic Missteps: The Danger of Lost Focus

• Sol diverted significant financial resources from Price Club's core business into real estate development, despite lower immediate returns and disapproval from executives and investors.
• This loss of focus on the company's main operations was considered a mistake, as real estate became more important to him than the warehouse business itself.
• Recognizing his strengths were in creativity rather than managing large operations, and tired of Wall Street pressure, Sol sold to Costco in 1993 when he felt it was time to move on.

Father-Son Partnership: A 40-Year Working Legacy

• Sol worked alongside his son Robert for nearly 45 years, teaching him everything from reading financial statements to management, fair dealing, and critical thinking.
• His teaching philosophy emphasized questioning assumptions, checking facts personally, remaining humble, appreciating life's unpredictability, and being there for people in need.
• Robert Price's greatest tribute was that Sol prepared him so thoroughly that "when it was time to step up, I was ready"—demonstrating the ultimate legacy of transferring life skills across generations.
