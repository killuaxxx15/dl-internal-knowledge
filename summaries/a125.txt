HOW TO WIN THE INVESTING GAME W/ JOEL GREENBLATT

Concentrated Portfolio Strategy (1980s-1990s)

• Averaged 40% annual returns over 20 years by focusing on 6-8 concentrated positions representing 80% of assets
• Targeted special situations like spinoffs, mergers, and complicated corporate structures where few analysts paid attention
• Sized positions based on downside risk rather than upside potential, taking larger positions in situations with significant margin of safety
• Required deep understanding of each investment to withstand volatility and emotional pressure

Evolution to Quality Businesses

• Shifted around 2000 to include "good businesses" alongside cheap valuations after studying Buffett's Coca-Cola investment
• Reverse-engineered Buffett's Moody's purchase, comparing valuation metrics to justify paying higher multiples for superior businesses
• Combined Ben Graham's focus on cheap stocks with Buffett's emphasis on quality, seeking companies with high returns on tangible capital
• Recognized that great businesses with network effects and global reach via internet represented unprecedented investment opportunities

The Magic Formula Development

• Created systematic approach combining two metrics: cheapness (earnings yield) and quality (return on tangible capital)
• Tested strategy from 1987 forward, showing consistent outperformance with top decile beating each subsequent decile
• Emphasized this wasn't data-mined but represented first test of logical investment principles
• Acknowledged that purely cheap stocks can outperform but with higher volatility

Partnership and Decision-Making

• 35-year partnership with Rob Goldstein built on independent thinking and truth-seeking rather than agreeability
• Both partners must agree on investments, with neither being a "yes-man" to the other
• Maintains discipline by having someone challenge ideas and prevent overconfidence that can affect successful investors
• Emphasizes importance of having intellectual equals who will honestly critique investment decisions

Current Investment Approach

• Runs diversified systematic portfolios using quantitative methods while maintaining some concentrated positions
• Holds long-term positions in exceptional businesses like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon that he views as superior franchises
• Believes current value portfolios are positioned for 35-40% returns over next few years based on historical analysis
• Balances systematic strategies with selective concentrated bets on businesses he considers undervalued

Risk Management and Emotional Discipline

• Learned early that unexpected events (like Florida Cypress Gardens sinkhole) can destroy even well-researched investments
• Developed philosophy that bad things happen but good luck usually outweighs bad luck over time
• Maintains perspective by focusing on businesses rather than daily stock price movements
• Returned outside investor money after 10 years to reduce emotional stress of managing others' capital

Success Academy Educational Model

• Applied business principles to education by creating replicable teaching systems rather than relying on exceptional individual teachers
• Focused on measurable outputs (student learning) rather than inputs (teacher credentials, resources)
• Scaled from one school to 47 schools serving 23,000 students, with disadvantaged students outperforming wealthy districts
• Demonstrated that systematic approaches can work in education just as in investing

Life Philosophy and Giving Back

• Emphasizes finding your circle of competence and only playing games you're equipped to win
• Views teaching, writing, and philanthropy as more meaningful than pure wealth accumulation
• Maintains humility despite success, crediting luck and favorable market conditions for much of his achievement
