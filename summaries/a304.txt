Frederick Smith (FedEx)

Origins Rooted in Entrepreneurial DNA

• Fred Smith's father built successful businesses from scratch (a bus company later sold to Greyhound), modeling the same relentless work ethic and gambler's instinct Fred would embody.
• Father and son shared defining traits: voracious reading habits, boundless energy, self-discipline, and a drive to find opportunity where others saw nothing.
• Fred's father died when he was 4, leaving an inheritance of ~$8–10M that Fred would nearly lose entirely building FedEx.

The Near-Death Struggles of Early FedEx

• FedEx almost collapsed multiple times in its first years — Smith was fired as CEO by his own board, investigated by the FBI for alleged bank fraud, and faced personal bankruptcy.
• In one legendary incident, Smith flew to Las Vegas with the company's last few hundred dollars and won ~$30,000 at blackjack to cover payroll/fuel — temporarily staving off shutdown.
• The financial and personal strain cost Smith his marriage; he was consumed by the business, reading 4 hours a day when not working.

Relentless Persistence as the Core Survival Strategy

• Smith refused to let FedEx die at any cost — begging investors, renegotiating loans, and personally convincing employees and backers to stay during the darkest moments.
• On multiple occasions he considered resignation and even reached out to General Dynamics (a key investor) asking for a management job after they denied him a loan.
• Key investors like Colonel Crown were persuaded to keep the faith through all-night conversations; their continued support was critical to survival.

Innovation Through Cross-Disciplinary Thinking

• The hub-and-spoke delivery model was inspired by how telephone networks operated — Smith cross-applied an idea from a completely different industry.
• FedEx pioneered real-time package tracking by adapting grocery store barcode technology to logistics — Smith described it as connecting dots from "soup cans" to overnight delivery.
• Smith's formula: read widely across disciplines, synthesize ideas, and apply them to unsolved problems.

The Role of Timing in Startup Success

• Smith argued FedEx would have failed 5 years earlier (infrastructure not ready) and been commoditized 5 years later (market too obvious for competitors).
• He drew a direct parallel to Eisenhower — being the right person with the right skills at the right moment is often more decisive than raw talent alone.
• Smith believed thousands of people have the same potential as any great founder; timing and execution are the differentiators.

Profitability and Explosive Growth Post-IPO

• FedEx's first profitable year was 1976 with $3.5M net income — just a few years after nearly going bankrupt.
• Profits scaled rapidly: $8.1M → $20M → $90M within 5 years of turning profitable, all within FedEx's first 9 years of existence.
• The IPO was the pivotal turning point that put the company on solid financial footing and launched its exponential growth phase.
