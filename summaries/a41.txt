Platinum Bombed - The Capital Cycle Podcast

Investment Philosophy: Certainty Creates Risk

• Investors increasingly seek certainty and comfort, driving up valuations of "quality" companies with stable business models, higher returns on capital, and little debt
• This search for certainty creates heightened valuation risk as any deviation from expected outcomes can cause material drawdowns in equity values
• Markets have become driven by a narrower subset of companies (like the Magnificent Seven) where investor belief in sustainability has reached extreme levels
• When the state of the world changes, what investors felt was certain suddenly becomes very uncertain, creating investment opportunities on the contrarian side
• This presents "Duffy's certainty instability hypothesis" - the more certainty in markets, the more valuation risk builds up, eventually creating uncertainty

Platinum Group Metals Overview and Characteristics

• Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) consist of three major commodities: platinum, palladium, and rhodium, with small amounts of gold extracted alongside
• Primary use is in catalytic converters attached to combustion engines to remove harmful and toxic emissions, making them critical for clean cities and removing NOx emissions
• They have unique properties including ability to withstand extremely high temperatures, making them effective catalysts with no alternatives outside the PGM group
• Platinum is 20 times rarer than gold in terms of mining, and both platinum and palladium are official monetary metals (XPT and XPD respectively)
• Jewelry demand accounts for 20% of platinum's overall demand, but these are predominantly industrial metals rather than monetary instruments

Geographic Concentration and Supply Constraints

• Supply is highly geographically concentrated: 80% of world's platinum is mined in South Africa, while palladium comes 45% from South Africa with remainder from Russia and small amounts from North America
• The sector experienced a short-lived upcycle from 2020-2022 due to COVID supply disruptions and inventory stocking by auto OEMs
• This was followed by significant price declines, with around 30% of the industry now loss-making on a cash basis
• The industry has lost around 80% of its market capitalization over the last couple of years
• Current prices have fallen to levels where it's no longer economic for a significant portion of the industry to produce

Capital Cycle Analysis and Underinvestment

• PGMs are exposed to long cycles similar to other mining industries, with the last major upcycle occurring around 2006-2008 before the recent 2020-2022 period
• The industry experienced a painful bear market from 2012-2020, leading to significant underinvestment that is now setting up supply disruption
• In eight of the last 10 years, capex spending has been below the level required to sustain current output
• Mining costs have increased by about 6% per annum, and capex costs have increased similarly, yet nominal capex levels are broadly flat
• The capex-to-depreciation ratio understates the degree of underinvestment because it's based on historic prices rather than current replacement costs

Supply Disruption and Future Constraints

• South African mines have seen reasonably significant declines in output and are expected to decrease by a further 10-15% over the next five years due to underinvestment
• Replacement costs are estimated to be around two to three times above current market levels, disincentivizing companies from adding new capacity
• Existing mines are being underinvested, storing up future supply problems, while new discoveries are not being made to replace mines reaching end of life
• The industry is consolidated to about four main producers who operate cross-subsidized portfolios, making them reluctant to close individual loss-making assets
• Supply response will likely come through inadvertent production misses rather than deliberate capacity cuts due to geological issues in underground mines

Recycling Supply Challenges

• Secondary supply from recycling accounts for approximately 20-25% of total industry supply, coming from scrapped vehicles after 8-10 years of useful life
• With 30% of mines loss-making, it has become uneconomic to recycle PGM metals from catalytic converters due to processing costs
• Each catalytic converter contains only two grams of metal valued at around $100, but labor, processing, and inventory financing costs make recycling unprofitable
• Vehicles are being driven longer than anticipated, meaning metal stays in the existing fleet longer, further tightening supply
• Strong projections about supply growth from recycling are disappointing due to the current price environment

Demand Outlook and Electric Vehicle Impact

• Long-term demand faces pressure from increasing battery electric vehicle market share, as EVs don't require catalytic converters
• In China, EVs now represent over a third of annual vehicle sales, causing palladium demand to decline
• However, in other markets, EV penetration is much slower than initial projections, creating less certainty about demand destruction
• Internal combustion engine sales have been growing year-on-year in absolute terms, not shrinking as expected
• Hybrid vehicles still require ICE engines with PGM loading, and heavy-duty trucks face tightening emission standards requiring more PGM per catalytic converter

Investment Strategy and Market Dynamics

• The physical commodity markets are quite tight, with annual usage versus supply in reasonably tight balance
• A 2-3% supply miss puts the market into deficit, forcing customers to buy at higher spot prices or bid up prices, creating demand destruction elsewhere
• Current opportunity exists at the intersection of constrained supply (observable through company actions) and uncertain demand forecasts
• The best investment approach is a diversified basket of stocks rather than concentrated positions, as supply disruptions will benefit all producers
• It's difficult to predict which specific company will experience supply outages, but confidence exists that industry-wide disruptions will occur
