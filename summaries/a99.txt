Shoe Dog: A Memoir by the Creator of Nike

The Origin of a "Crazy Idea"

• Phil Knight's eureka moment came during a morning run in 1962, realizing he wanted work that felt like "play" - meaningful, creative, and different
• His "crazy idea" was importing inexpensive Japanese running shoes to compete with European brands dominating the U.S. market
• Started as a Stanford business school paper that received an A, despite classmates' indifference to his passionate presentation
• Knight believed the world is built on crazy ideas and that entrepreneurs should embrace being called crazy while never stopping

The Power of Belief in Sales

• Knight struggled selling encyclopedias and mutual funds but excelled at selling running shoes because he genuinely believed in running and the product
• His simple strategy: attend track meets, talk to coaches and runners, and let his authentic belief drive sales rather than traditional selling techniques
• People sensed his genuine belief and wanted to share in it, making the shoes essentially "sell themselves"
• This authentic passion became the foundation for building customer loyalty and word-of-mouth marketing

Key Partnerships That Built Nike

• Bill Bowerman: Knight's former track coach became co-founder (49% stake), obsessed with shoe innovation and making them lighter
• Bowerman was a demanding, almost mythical figure who taught Knight about leadership under pressure and the importance of testing limits
• Jeff Johnson: First full-time employee, an eccentric runner who wrote daily letters and created Nike's first retail store as a "sanctuary for runners"
• Johnson built an analog customer database, sending personalized correspondence and turning customer service into relationship building

The Struggle Years and Going Full-Time

• Knight worked full-time at Price Waterhouse for the first 6-7 years while building Blue Ribbon (pre-Nike) on nights and weekends
• Didn't go full-time with his company until age 31, paying himself only $18,000 annually - demonstrating patience over quick success
• The company operated on razor-thin margins with constant cash flow problems, owing $11,000 to the bank during early growth phases
• This period taught valuable lessons about dedication, sacrifice, and the long-term nature of building something meaningful

The Birth of Nike Brand

• Originally distributed Tiger shoes from Japanese company Onitsuka, but faced supply chain issues and eventual termination
• When cut off from their main supplier, Knight reframed the crisis as "liberation" and "Independence Day" for the team
• Transitioned from selling others' products to creating their own brand - a critical lesson about controlling your own destiny
• The company's survival depended on this pivot, echoing Henry Ford's principle of controlling your own "basket"

Life Lessons and Regrets

• After Nike's IPO (same week as Apple), Knight felt regret rather than joy, wishing he could do it all over again
• His primary regret was not spending more time with his sons, highlighting the eternal tension between ambition and family
• Advised young entrepreneurs to "seek a calling" rather than just a job, emphasizing that following your calling makes fatigue and disappointments bearable
• Warned that America is becoming less entrepreneurial, with entrepreneurs always fighting uphill battles against those who "live to say no"

Final Wisdom for Entrepreneurs

• Sometimes knowing when to give up and try something else is genius, but "giving up doesn't mean stopping - don't ever stop"
• Entrepreneurs will always have targets on their backs, with bigger success bringing bigger challenges
• The best remedy for discouragement is to "hit pause" and think carefully about how you want to spend the next 40 years of your life
• Success comes from pressing through typical discouragements while maintaining the "same drive, same dream" that fuels all creative endeavors
