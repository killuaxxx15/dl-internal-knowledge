Les Schwab (Charlie Munger recommended this book)

The Power of Shrewd Incentive Systems

• Schwab’s most significant business discovery was a profit-sharing model where each individual store functioned as its own entity, with workers receiving 50% of the profits.
• Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett frequently cite this system as a masterclass in using "shrewd" compensation to drive performance in difficult industries.
• This structure created self-policing environments where employees were motivated to prevent dishonesty and waste because it directly impacted their own families' income.
• Schwab believed that making employees successful was the only sustainable way to achieve personal and corporate success in a capitalistic society.

Cultivating a Fanatical Competitive Advantage

• Warren Buffett describes Schwab as a "fanatical" competitor, noting that it is nearly impossible to compete against someone with such obsessive focus on their craft.
• Schwab maintained rigorous standards, such as requiring tires in the showroom to be dusted and waxed daily to impress customers with a "supermarket" display.
• He often drove over 600 miles in a single day to visit field locations, ensuring his specific business theories and service standards were being executed perfectly.
• His fanaticism extended to constant learning; Schwab believed in knowing more about his specific craft than anyone else in the industry.

Customer Reciprocity and Unconventional Marketing

• Schwab grew his business through "unselfish" tactics, such as fixing flat tires for free even for people who were not yet customers.
• This strategy relied on the psychological principle of reciprocity, as people often returned to purchase new tires from the shop that had helped them for free.
• He believed advertising must be done with "gusto," preferring high-volume repetition (such as 10 radio ads a day) over small, scattered expenditures.
• Schwab intentionally inverted industry norms, such as turning the tire warehouse into the showroom to impress customers with immediate selection.

Strategic Independence from Industry Cartels

• Schwab broke away from major American rubber companies because he felt their pricing policies "milked" local dealers of their profits.
• He transitioned to a "supermarket" model, remaining independent to buy high-quality tires from various suppliers, including then-emerging Japanese companies like Toyo.
• While competitors invested heavily in expensive service trucks that visited clients once a week, Schwab invested in stores where clients came to him six days a week.
• He viewed the eventual failure of major rubber companies as a just result of them losing focus on their dealers and customers.

Long-Term Ownership and Asset Building

• Schwab was adamant about owning the land and buildings for his stores, following a "rule" never to build a business on someone else's property.
• He resisted the urge to go public or sell to major investors like Warren Buffett, preferring total control over business decisions and employee welfare.
• His long-term vision involved reinvesting profits back into the company for expansion rather than taking large salaries or early payouts.
• By maintaining a private, family-owned structure, he avoided pressure from outside investors who might question high manager compensation or long-term investments.

Front-Line Leadership and Corporate Focus

• Schwab maintained that the most important people in any company are the "firing line" employees who perform the service and interact with customers.
• He criticized American corporations for paying outrageous bonuses to executives while treating front-line workers as "peons," viewing this as a competitive opening.
• In his organization, store managers often made significantly more money than office personnel or people with advanced degrees.
• He insisted that the sole purpose of a corporate office is to serve the individual stores, not the other way around.
