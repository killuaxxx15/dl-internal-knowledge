Charles Schulz (Charlie Brown)

A Career Defined by Unwavering Dedication

• Schulz personally wrote, penciled, inked, and lettered all 17,897 Peanuts strips across nearly 50 years, never delegating creative work.
• His final strip was published the day after his death on February 13, 2000 — a testament to his commitment to the craft.
• He viewed his work simply: "I sit down at my desk and draw funny pictures," keeping his purpose grounded no matter how famous he became.

Master One Thing and Never Sell Out

• Schulz's core advice: learn to do at least one task exceptionally well, and do it on the highest possible plane.
• He cautioned against compromising for "baser elements" of your profession — if given a talent, use it with gratitude and integrity.
• His entire career modeled this: despite presidential calls, Guinness records, and Apollo mission recognition, he never strayed from cartooning.

Slow, Compounding Growth Over Decades

• Peanuts grew from 7 newspapers in 1950 to 2,000+ over 34 years — a model of patient, uninterrupted compounding.
• The key insight: the primary risk is quitting early and interrupting the compounding curve before results become extraordinary.
• By the end, Schulz held the Guinness World Record for the most widely syndicated cartoonist, with over 1,400 books and 300 million copies sold.

Creative Independence and Self-Trust

• Schulz strongly preferred solo work — drawing directly from mind to hand — over collaborative mediums like film or TV.
• He never showed work to others for approval: "I just try to please myself. I never try to please a certain audience — I think that's disastrous."
• He believed no critic or audience could understand his work better than he did, a philosophy borne out when a famous critic predicted Peanuts' imminent end — 20 years and 1,500 additional newspapers before Schulz retired.

Staying Power Requires Identity and Fit

• Schulz framed long-term success as doing what you are uniquely qualified to do, not what is most prestigious.
• He cited S.J. Perelman: "The muralist is no more valid than the miniature painter" — scale doesn't determine worth.
• At 36 years into his career, he still sought to surpass his own previous work, showing that staying power is driven by internal standards, not external validation.

Carrying On Despite Life's Pressures

• Schulz openly acknowledged personal struggles, including periods of depression and disturbing dreams, while maintaining his daily creative output.
• He saw the ability to sustain quality despite personal hardship as the defining characteristic that separates great work from weak work.
• His message: maturity means setting anger and difficulty aside and simply carrying on with your daily work — a universal lesson beyond cartooning.
