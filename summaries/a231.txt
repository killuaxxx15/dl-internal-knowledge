Thomas Watson (IBM)

Early Struggles and the NCR Apprenticeship

• Before his success, Watson experienced significant failure in his youth, including failed ventures as a salesman and butcher, and getting fired after losing a horse and wagon while drinking.
• He eventually found his footing at National Cash Register (NCR) under the mentorship of John Patterson, a tyrannical leader whose dictatorial style heavily influenced Watson's future management approach.
• At NCR, Watson successfully ran a secret "fake" subsidiary funded by the parent company, which was designed to ruthlessly destroy the used cash register market and eliminate competition.

Crisis and Reinvention at Age 40

• Watson's career at NCR ended in disaster when he and other executives were indicted for criminal violations of the Sherman Anti-Trust law, facing potential imprisonment.
• At age 40, he was fired, facing jail time, and expecting a child; this trauma became the catalyst for his desire to rebuild his reputation and prove he was a moral businessman.
• To salvage his career, he partnered with entrepreneur Charles Flint to turn around a failing trust called the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR), which would later become IBM.

The Philosophy of Uncapped Upside

• Despite having no capital to invest, Watson negotiated a compensation package that gave him a salary plus 5% of the company's profits.
• This deal structure ensured that his financial potential was not capped, eventually making him the highest-paid CEO in America as the company grew.
• Watson's arrangement serves as a lesson in the value of performance-based equity over fixed salaries, allowing an individual to capture the upside of the value they create.

Cultivating a Fanatical Corporate Culture

• Watson built a "cult-like" culture at IBM, demanding absolute loyalty and infusing the company with his own aggressive optimism and strict behavioral standards.
• He implemented the famous slogan "Think," encouraging employees to engage in rigorous, uninterrupted thought before acting, a habit he practiced religiously himself.
• While often narcissistic and demanding, he balanced his tyranny with extreme benevolence, personally helping employees during tragedies, which cemented a deep, army-like devotion among his staff.

Strategic Focus and Counter-Cyclical Investment

• Watson shifted the company's focus away from time clocks and scales, correctly identifying that tabulating machines (punch cards) and data processing held unlimited future potential.
• During the Great Depression, he made the risky decision to refuse layoffs and actually increased spending on research and development while competitors were cutting costs.
• He modeled his strategy on the belief that superior technology and patents would drive sales regardless of economic conditions, effectively monopolizing the tabulating market.

The Intersection of Luck and Preparation

• IBM's massive breakthrough occurred in 1935 with the passage of the Social Security Act, which created an overnight demand for government data processing on an unprecedented scale.
• Because Watson had kept factories running during the Depression, IBM was the only company with the inventory and technology ready to meet this sudden government demand.
• This event acted as a "slingshot" for the company, securing its dominance in the data processing industry for the next 45 years.
