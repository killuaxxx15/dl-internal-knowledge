Akio Morita: Founder of Sony

Akio Morita's Early Life and Background

• Akio Morita was born as the first son in the 15th generation of a wealthy 300-year-old sake brewing family, expected to inherit the family business that had been restored to prosperity by his father after previous generations nearly caused bankruptcy by neglecting the business
• From childhood, Morita was taught about his ancestors and business principles, with his father grooming him to carry on the family legacy by bringing him to the family office, breweries, and even board meetings by age 10-11
• Despite family expectations to study economics, Morita became obsessed with electronics and physics, building his own devices as a hobby that sometimes affected his schoolwork, and eventually chose to study physics in college against his father's wishes
• Morita described himself as having "immense self-confidence" from a young age and believed he had "a role to play in the future of Japan" even amid the devastation of World War II
• He had grown up with access to Western products and technology (Ford, Buick, General Electric), giving him an appreciation for American technological capabilities that informed his outlook during and after the war

The Founding of Sony

• Sony began in post-war Japan when Masaru Ibuka, who Morita had met during wartime research projects, established Tokyo Telecommunications Research Laboratories in a bombed-out department store building
• When Morita learned of Ibuka's new venture, he immediately wrote to him offering help, and arranged to teach physics during the day while working with Ibuka, living on his teaching salary
• Morita's father gave his blessing for his son to pursue this path rather than the family business, telling him: "You are going to do what you like best," and later provided loans that were converted to equity
• The early working conditions were incredibly primitive - they worked in a bombed-out building where they needed umbrellas at their desks when it rained, shocking Morita's wealthy relatives who thought he had "become an anarchist"
• Their first breakthrough came when they won a contract to build mixing units for the American occupation forces, delivering such high-quality equipment that it earned them trust and further opportunities

Sony's Business Philosophy

• From the beginning, Morita and Ibuka positioned Sony as an innovator that would make high-technology products in ingenious ways, not just building conventional products like radios
• They decided to charge premium prices for high-quality products, aiming to change Japan's post-war reputation for cheap, copycat goods, with Morita saying "we at Sony have always been fanatics about quality"
• Morita refused a massive order from Bulova worth several times Sony's capital because they wanted to remove the Sony name from the products - he was determined to build Sony's brand identity even at great short-term cost
• They rejected market research, believing "the public does not know what is possible, but we do" and instead focused on refining their thinking on products and creating markets through education and communication
• Sony pioneered direct-to-consumer distribution, opening their own showrooms in Tokyo's Ginza district and New York's Fifth Avenue, believing intermediaries wouldn't share their enthusiasm for their products

Morita's Leadership and Management Philosophy

• Morita stressed long-term thinking in business decisions, often fighting with more cautious executives about spending on marketing and product launches, viewing it as investing for returns that would come in 5-10 years
• He spent significant time with younger employees, having dinner with them nightly, which helped him identify problems like bad managers when many employees under a particular manager requested transfers
• Morita emphasized the Japanese concept of "mottainai" (avoiding waste), believing that designing with constraints and being resourceful at individual, company, and country levels gave Sony a competitive advantage
• He advocated for investing in factories before offices, believing that plush corporate environments signaled misplaced priorities to Japanese clients who would suspect the company wasn't serious about its products
• Morita had a paid critic named Norio Ohga who provided honest feedback on Sony's products, eventually rising to become Sony's president, demonstrating Morita's value of constructive criticism

Innovation and Product Development

• Sony's first successful product was a shortwave adapter that could be attached to existing radios (which were widespread during wartime), leveraging an existing install base to gain traction
• After spotting a tape recorder at the American broadcasting facility, Sony developed their own, then realized they needed to find the right target market (courts needing to record proceedings) rather than selling to general consumers
• The Walkman was created when Ibuka complained about carrying heavy equipment to listen to music privately - Morita ordered engineers to strip the recording circuit and speaker from a cassette player and add lightweight headphones
• Despite internal resistance to the Walkman concept (marketing people questioned if consumers would buy a device without recording capability), Morita was so confident he took personal responsibility for the project, which became a massive success
• Morita constantly looked for technological developments from other companies (like Bell Labs' transistor invention) that Sony could leverage to make products smaller and more portable

Morita's Global Vision

• Morita recognized early that Japanese companies needed to export goods to survive, and that selling high-quality, expensive products required affluent markets in rich, sophisticated countries
• He moved his entire family to the United States to gain direct experience of American lifestyle and thinking, believing his future and Sony's depended on understanding the American market
• Sony became the first Japanese company to sell stock in the United States, part of Morita's strategy to position Sony globally
• During visits to other countries like the Soviet Union, Morita assessed their manufacturing potential but found a lack of attention to detail and quality, advising them to combine their artistic traditions with technology
• Morita's global perspective was influenced by his early exposure to Western technology and his belief that Japan needed to "keep pace with the progress of the world" as the Emperor had urged after the war

The Importance of Marketing and Consumer Education

• Morita realized that having unique technology and products wasn't enough - they needed to learn to sell products by showing potential buyers their real value
• He compared educating customers to the Japanese gardening technique of "nemawashi" (preparing a tree for transplanting by gradually binding roots), emphasizing that it takes time and patience
• When Sony expanded to America, Morita applied the same showroom concept that had worked in Tokyo's Ginza district to Fifth Avenue in New York, targeting affluent customers who could afford premium products
• Morita insisted on significant marketing investment for new products, once threatening to fire a Sony president who was reluctant to spend on promotion, arguing that saving money instead of investing was "cashing in on assets built in the past"
• Sony benefited from being first to market with innovative products, often having the market to themselves for a year or more while competitors took a "wait-and-see" attitude

Morita's Personal Qualities and Impact

• Morita described himself as "cocky" and self-confident from youth, believing in his abilities even during Japan's most difficult post-war period, traits he considered essential for innovation
• His influence extended beyond Sony to inspire other entrepreneurs, with Jeff Bezos, James Dyson, Phil Knight, and Steve Jobs all citing Morita and Sony as role models for their own companies
• Morita emphasized personal discipline, applying high standards to himself, his children, and his business, believing that mental and physical challenges revealed hidden strengths
• He demonstrated remarkable determination and conviction in his decisions, from choosing physics over the family business to refusing lucrative deals that compromised Sony's identity
• Morita encouraged employees to find fulfillment in their work, telling them: "Nobody can live twice in the next 20 or 30 years... When your life is finished, I do not want you to regret that you spent all those years here"

Sony's Evolution and Adaptation

• Sony constantly evolved by identifying and adopting new technologies rather than fighting against technological progress, with Morita teaching managers they needed to "harness technology" and use it to invent new products
• The company shifted from initial simple products like radio adapters to increasingly sophisticated electronics, always aiming to create markets rather than follow them
• Sony benefited from being first to market with innovative products, often having the market to themselves for a year or more while competitors took a "wait-and-see" attitude
• When facing international competitors, Sony's emphasis on quality differentiation and innovation proved successful against companies that either gave up too easily (like Regency with their pocket radio) or lacked marketing vision
• Morita observed how Dutch company Philips had built a global technology giant from "a small town in a small corner of a small agricultural country," which inspired him to believe Sony could achieve similar global success from Japan
