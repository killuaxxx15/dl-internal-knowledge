How Bill Gates Works

Fanatical Focus and Obsession

• Gates discovered early that he thrived on obsession, saying "I loved being a fanatic" and didn't believe in weekends or vacations
• He developed an ability to hyper-focus for extreme periods—regularly working 36+ hours straight, sometimes up to 100 hours without leaving
• This intensity manifested as "living in binary states"—either completely apathetic or totally obsessed with no middle ground
• Larry Ellison noted Gates' defining traits were not brilliance alone, but "focus and endurance" that were utterly relentless

Early Programming and Self-Education

• Gates consumed information voraciously, reading entire encyclopedia sets A-Z and devouring shelves of books on topics that interested him
• Programming appealed to him because it rewarded logical thinking, attention to detail, and allowed him to define his own measures of success
• He literally dumpster-dove for computer code printouts to learn from professional programmers' work
• A formative 4-month period of unrestricted computer access "minted a work style that would last for decades"

Lean Engineering Philosophy

• Gates believed "lean engineering is good engineering"—early memory constraints forced efficient, minimal code
• This extended to business operations: he had a "visceral, disgusting reaction" to waste and inefficiency
• Microsoft maintained extreme leanness—just 11-12 employees after 4 years, fewer than 40 when partnering with IBM despite $7M in sales
• He wanted a one-year cash buffer at all times and never needed the venture capital money they raised

Ruthless Cost Control

• Gates was described as "a demon on costs" who tracked every penny and berated employees who didn't
• He would prowl parking lots on weekends, memorizing license plates to see who was working
• When an employee worked 81 hours in 4 days, Gates asked what he was doing on day 5, genuinely confused why he'd take time off
• This financial conservatism made Microsoft a "money printing machine" that generated cash from day one

Competitive Intensity	

• Gates wanted not just to win but to "eliminate opponents from the playing field" and "destroy" competitors
• He held "Borland War Councils" where staff plotted against rival Philippe Kahn, even distributing "Delete Philippe" t-shirts
• Was once spotted at a conference staring at a photograph of Kahn—when asked, confirmed it was his competitor's picture
• Believed losing a $50K contract was a $100K loss since the competitor gained what Microsoft lost

Combative Work Style

• Gates thrived on conflict and used it to reach better solutions, famously saying "that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard" to weak arguments
• He respected people who pushed back with well-reasoned positions but had no patience for those who hadn't thought things through
• His intensity made him "aggressive, rebellious, and contemptuous" even as a child—described as becoming "an adult overnight" at age 9
• A family therapist told his parents: "Give it up. He's going to win"

Strategic Business Decisions

• Gates insisted on owning rather than licensing products, believing "it's always better if you want to control and benefit from the evolution of a product to own it"
• He refused to sell Microsoft to Ross Perot in 1979 for "mid-seven figures" when revenue was only $2.4M, insisting on independence
• The non-exclusive DOS licensing deal with IBM (rather than per-copy royalties) became Microsoft's "biggest asset" and foundation for dominance
• Focused purely on software rather than hardware, competing against "in-house engineering budgets" rather than other companies

Never Satisfied Mentality

• Gates maintained a "top 10 mistakes" memo he updated yearly to avoid repeating errors
• Even with 20,000 employees and $20B net worth in 1997, he saw the glass as "7/8 empty"
• "We never talk about things we've been successful at. We always talk about challenges ahead. There is no finish line"
• Predicted $55B market opportunity when actual future revenue would be $280B—couldn't foresee full potential

Singular Commitment

• Gates rejected the term "entrepreneur," saying he was "a software engineer first" who decided to gather a team
• "My job is the best job. I am more committed to my job than most. Nobody is going to get me interested in some other job"
• Unlike founders who "fade away," he remained interested in what each next stage required for 20+ years
• His identity was inseparable from Microsoft—"he'd get confused about where the company left off and he began"
