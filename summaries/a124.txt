EXANTE Webinar ‘Beach Reads & Bond Yields’

Dollar Weakness and Structural Shifts

• Dollar declined over 10% year-to-date, contrary to expectations that tariffs would strengthen it
• Tariffs may reduce capital allocation efficiency, making US assets less attractive to investors
• Central bank independence concerns and fiscal policy shifts outside the US contributed to dollar weakness
• Historical precedent from emerging markets shows tariffs often lead to currency depreciation

Geopolitics Driving Economic Realignment

• US retreat from global defense umbrella forces allies to increase military spending (Europe to 5% of GDP, Japan similar levels)
• Increased defense spending by surplus countries reduces global savings available for US markets
• This shift may make US deficit financing more expensive and less advantageous
• German fiscal policy already responding with abandonment of debt brake rules

Supply Shock Era and Inflation Dynamics

• Post-2020 world characterized by serial supply shocks rather than demand shocks of 1998-2020 period
• COVID, Ukraine war, and deglobalization create ongoing supply constraints
• This environment favors emerging markets as dollar weakness provides monetary policy autonomy
• Bond markets face persistent inflationary pressures from supply-side constraints

Currency Competition and Reserve Diversification

• Dollar remains dominant in cross-border lending despite reserve currency competition
• China increasing renminbi lending in Asia and BRI countries, moving away from dollar-denominated loans
• Euro lacks unified safe asset market despite having banking infrastructure and free tradability
• Gold reserves at central banks now exceed dollar reserves in value, reflecting sanctions concerns

Emerging Market Opportunities

• Countries with high financial exposure but low real exposure to US (like Brazil) benefit from dollar weakness
• Mexico faces complex USMCA renegotiation between nearshoring and reshoring pressures
• ASEAN pursuing trade diversification beyond US, with genuine economic restructuring occurring
• Global South generally moving toward reduced dependence on US final demand

Monetary Policy Independence Under Pressure

• Traditional monetary policy-currency relationships breaking down in developed markets
• Fed's third mandate for "moderate long-term interest rates" gaining attention alongside employment and inflation targets
• Stagflation risks identified by Fed officials, disagreeing only on whether growth or inflation pressures dominate
• Geopolitical factors increasingly override pure carry trade considerations in currency markets
