HIGH-PERFORMANCE HABITS W/ GUY SPIER (2022)

Managing Attention and Information Overload

• The challenge of being accessible while protecting time and focus requires strategic boundaries and clear mission alignment
• Engaging with incoming requests through the lens of life mission helps filter opportunities and build meaningful teams rather than shallow fan relationships
• Creating systems like internships, educational events, and "now pages" helps structure interactions productively while managing scale limitations
• The key is making people part of your movement or mission rather than treating engagement as ego-driven celebrity management

ADHD and Focus Strategies

• ADHD manifests differently for everyone—labels are useful but don't capture individual nuances; some people achieve hyperfocus under pressure or deep interest
• Practical workarounds include supportive partners/assistants who understand the condition, structured physical environments with visual reminders, and medication when appropriate
• Low-dose Vyvanse (20mg) can improve focus significantly without eliminating creativity or changing core personality
• The condition can be both handicap and asset depending on context—financial security can actually reduce the fear-driven motivation that sometimes produces hyperfocus

Creating Environments for Deep Thinking

• Space repetition system: Review important ideas at increasing intervals (now/few weeks/sometime) using physical papers away from computer distractions
• Closing open loops: Capture thoughts externally to reduce mental burden and trust your system will surface them again
• Owning small stakes (~100 companies) ensures regular exposure to annual reports and maintains long-term awareness without active monitoring
• The calm pond metaphor: Reduce distractions so subtle insights can be noticed, allowing subconscious processing between reviews

Relationships as Core Infrastructure

• The most valuable environment isn't physical—it's the ecosystem of relationships you cultivate
• Strategic choices about where to live should prioritize proximity to important people over amenities like transit systems
• Gradually drawing positive influences closer while letting negative ones drift to periphery shapes your ecosystem without dramatic confrontations
• Quality relationships teach you everything you need to know and create compounding opportunities over time

Life Mission and Destination Analysis

• Document your life mission in a shareable form that can attract aligned people and opportunities
• Break down goals by timeframe (1 month/3 months/6 months/1 year) across life domains: relationships, family, business
• Review regularly (e.g., High Holy Days) to celebrate successes and acknowledge failures, adjusting priorities accordingly
• Writing your own obituary or funeral speech clarifies what truly matters and guides daily decisions

Compounding Goodwill

• Start small with what's in front of you (even giving out candy), then analyze and improve your approach
• Focus goodwill efforts on people who've already engaged with you to encourage more positive interaction
• Results often manifest in ways you can't track or attribute—the practice resets your entire environment
• Examples: Thank you notes leading to friendship with Mohnish Pabrai, holiday cards leading to Harvard Business School Alumni Board invitation

Optimizing for the Right Things

• Don't optimize for returns or assets under management—optimize for reaching destinations with great company
• Warren Buffett's true wealth is "below the waterline": relationships, opportunities, and goodwill far exceed his financial wealth
• The thought experiment: If all ownership disappeared but businesses remained, who would have more opportunities—you or someone with stronger relationships?
• Leave value on the table in every deal to build long-term goodwill rather than extracting maximum short-term value

Radical Truthfulness

• Small lies twist the fabric of reality—it always snaps back, often years later in unexpected ways
• Being truthful, even about uncomfortable personal facts, aligns you with reality and creates better outcomes
• Jordan Peterson's insight: You never get away with anything; reality always bears down on lies and destroys them
• Living by inner scorecard and being willing to share everything publicly (like Warren's lunch approach) builds genuine power

Breadth vs. Depth in Life

• Following genuine curiosity about diverse subjects (mathematics, literature, etc.) enriches life and may reveal unexpected insights
• Feelings of envy about others' experiences often signal desires worth pursuing—respect and act on them
• A narrow focus on success metrics misses the point—life mission should honor your full self and destiny
• Charlie Munger reads no fiction, but breadth works for others—the key is being true to yourself and your curiosities
