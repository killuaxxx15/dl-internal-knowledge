Bernstein, The greatest 5 min. in music education

Musical Evolution Through Harmonic Series Integration

• Music development follows the natural progression of the harmonic series, with humanity gradually assimilating each successive interval over millennia
• The process begins with prehistoric hominids singing in unison, then naturally progressing to octaves when men, women, and children sing together due to natural voice pitch differences
• Each new interval absorbed represents a major leap forward in musical sophistication, transforming the entire sound and complexity of music
• The octave interval serves as the foundation, being the first interval of the harmonic series that humans naturally discovered and incorporated
• This evolutionary process demonstrates how musical vocabulary becomes "constantly enriched by more and more remote and chromatic overtones"

The Historical Progression of Intervallic Development

• The octave came first as the natural interval between men's and women's voices, establishing the foundation for all subsequent harmonic development
• Centuries later, humanity assimilated the fifth interval, which brought music forward approximately ten million years into the tenth century A.D. and introduced sophisticated musical culture
• The fourth interval was then admitted, allowing for mixing of octaves, fifths, and fourths, creating the beginnings of true polyphony
• The integration of the third interval marked a revolutionary change, creating "a whole new music, richer, mellower, with a new coloristic warmth"
• The third interval's incorporation introduced the phenomenon of the triad, fundamentally transforming musical structure and leading to what we recognize as tonal music

The Birth and Foundation of Tonal Music

• Tonal music emerged as a stable tonal language firmly rooted in the basic notes of the harmonic series, specifically the fundamental and its first different overtone
• The tonic-dominant relationship became the cornerstone of musical structure, with the fifth interval truly "dominating" the system
• This tonic-dominant establishment created unprecedented opportunities for composers, allowing for complex harmonic progressions and modulations
• The system enabled the creation of chains of fifths, where each fifth could serve as a new tonic producing its own dominant
• The stability of this system provided the framework that allowed for both chromatic exploration and tonal control

The Circle of Fifths and Chromatic Scale Generation

• The circle of fifths consists of 12 different fifths that can be constructed by proceeding either upwards or downwards from any starting point
• Ascending circle: C-G-D-A-E-B-F#-C#-G#-D#-A#-F-C, demonstrating how 12 fifths return to the starting tone
• Descending circle: C-F-Bb-Eb-Ab-Db-Gb-B-E-A-D-G-C, showing the same cyclical pattern in reverse
• When all 12 tones from the circle of fifths are arranged in scale order, they generate the complete chromatic scale
• These 12 notes create a circle of 12 keys, enabling composers to modulate freely through the perfected temperate system

Chromatic Freedom and Tonal Control Balance

• The temperate system's perfection allowed composers to engage in "freewheeling chromatic pleasure" while maintaining structural integrity
• Music can become extremely chromatic ("chromatic porridge" and even "goulash" in the 20th century) while still maintaining tonal coherence
• The containment of "loose, runny chromaticism" is achieved through the basic principle of diatonicism and stable tonic-dominant relationships
• Composers can modulate as freely and chromatically as desired while retaining complete tonal control through the system of tonics, dominants, subdominants, and supertonics
• This balance allows for maximum harmonic exploration without losing the foundational stability that makes music comprehensible and emotionally effective

Bach's Genius in Balancing Musical Forces

• Johann Sebastian Bach perfected and codified the great system of tonal controls that governs Western music
• Bach's particular genius lay in his ability to balance "so delicately and so justly" the two fundamental forces of chromaticism and diatonicism
• These forces were equally powerful yet presumably contradictory in nature, making Bach's achievement of perfect balance all the more remarkable
• Bach's work represents the culmination of centuries of musical evolution, demonstrating how the harmonic series principles could be fully realized
• His codification of tonal control systems provided the foundation that allowed subsequent composers to explore chromatic possibilities while maintaining musical coherence
