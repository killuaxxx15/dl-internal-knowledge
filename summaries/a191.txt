Yes It’s an AI Bubble. Here’s Why (with Albert Edwards) | Merryn Talks Money

AI Bubble Confirmation and Historical Parallels

• Albert Edwards, a global strategist at Société Générale, confirms the current market is in a bubble, drawing direct comparisons to the late-1990s dot-com era where compelling narratives justified extreme valuations.
• Tech stocks are trading at over 30 times forward earnings, with investors justifying rich valuations through earnings growth expectations—mirroring the mentality that preceded the Nasdaq crash.
• Like the telecom sector in the late 90s, massive AI capital investment is sucking money from other economic sectors, creating both an earnings bubble and a valuation bubble simultaneously.

Missing Traditional Crash Triggers

• Unlike previous bubbles that burst due to Fed tightening, current conditions show the Fed lowering interest rates and moving toward quantitative easing, potentially fueling a further "melt-up."
• The absence of monetary tightening makes the timing of the crash unpredictable and could allow the bubble to inflate significantly further before collapsing.
• Edwards warns that the longer the bubble continues, the more damaging the eventual crash will be, though he acknowledges feeling similar to 1999 when he "got bored being bearish."

Economic Fragility Beneath Market Highs

• Small businesses (those with fewer than 50 employees) comprise 45% of US employment and are experiencing year-over-year employment declines—an unusual and concerning trend.
• Consumption growth is concentrated among wealthy individuals whose wealth is inflated by stock market gains, while the bottom 50% of income earners show poor consumption patterns.
• The disconnect between all-time stock market highs and weakening employment in the economy's "job generators" suggests the foundation is being pulled out from underneath the rally.

AI Vendor Financing Concerns

• Current AI investment exhibits "vendor financing" schemes similar to the dot-com bubble, where companies essentially fund each other's growth in circular patterns.
• This interdependent financing structure creates systemic vulnerability, as the collapse of one major player could trigger cascading failures throughout the AI investment ecosystem.
• The concentration of economic growth in AI-related capital expenditure rather than broad-based productivity creates fragility masked by headline GDP numbers.

Investment Strategy for Bubble Environment

• Edwards recommends momentum investing with strict exit signals (like the S&P cutting below its 200-day moving average) rather than buying into the narrative.
• Investors should hold precious metals and inexpensive equities while maintaining extreme cynicism about market stories, following George Soros's approach of "running toward bubbles" but with clear exit plans.
• The key is to "keep dancing while the music's playing" but position yourself away from maximum risk, using technical indicators rather than fundamental conviction to time your exit.

Long-Term Outlook and Recession Inevitability

• The US hasn't experienced a proper cyclical downturn since 2008 (excluding pandemic months), making the current expansion extraordinarily long and a recession statistically overdue.
• Edwards dismisses optimistic scenarios around AI-driven productivity solving fiscal problems, suggesting the UK is "almost de-industrialized" and it's "too late" for energy reforms to be transformative.
• The business cycle cannot be abolished, and when recession arrives, bubble elements will implode—potentially with the bubble implosion itself triggering the economic downturn.
