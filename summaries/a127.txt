MEET THE MASTER W/ ASWATH DAMODARAN

Background and Teaching Philosophy

• Damodaran grew up in pre-modern India within an extended family environment that fostered debate and discussion, shaping his communication style
• Discovered his passion for teaching accidentally as a UCLA graduate student when financial necessity led him to work as a teaching assistant
• Made the radical decision to provide all his NYU courses online for free, believing knowledge should be shared and preferring larger audiences
• Emphasizes being true to your own teaching and communication style rather than copying others

Investment Philosophy and Valuation Approach

• Believes every asset has intrinsic value that can be estimated, and prices eventually converge to value over time
• Uses a simplified valuation framework focused on three key drivers: revenue growth, operating margins, and reinvestment needs
• Organizes all research data into these three categories to avoid information overload and maintain focus
• Maintains internal consistency by selling when stocks become overvalued, even if it means leaving money on the table (sold Amazon four times)

Critique of ESG and Market Trends

• Views ESG as fundamentally flawed because it promises "goodness without sacrifice" when historically being good has always required trade-offs
• Criticizes ESG research quality and notes the movement creates perverse incentives for companies and asset managers
• Describes Bitcoin as "currency created by the paranoid for the paranoid," born from 2008 financial crisis distrust of institutions
• Distinguishes between trading (focused on mood and momentum) and investing (focused on intrinsic value), avoiding cryptocurrencies because they can only be priced, not valued

Risk Management and Behavioral Insights

• Advocates portfolio diversification and automated selling rules to prevent overconcentration in any single position
• Emphasizes the "sleep test" - if investments cause worry or sleepless nights, something is wrong with the strategy
• Warns against concentration risk and emotional investing driven by regret or anger toward other market participants
• Separates macro views (for asset allocation) from company analysis (for stock selection) to maintain focus

Personal Philosophy and Career Advice

• Prioritizes independence and the ability to "abandon" any situation, viewing this freedom as essential for authentic work
• Lives below his means and avoids consulting or expert witness work to maintain editorial independence
• Advocates for incremental progress over grand plans, noting how small daily actions compound into significant achievements over time
• Emphasizes the importance of humility in investing, recognizing that luck plays a dominant role in short-term success
