Teddy Roosevelt and J.P. Morgan

Two Titans with Mirrored Personalities

• Roosevelt and Morgan shared strikingly similar traits — commanding presence, supreme confidence, impatience, and an unshakable belief that they alone should steer the nation's course — yet neither would have admitted the resemblance.
• Morgan was shaped profoundly by his father Junius, the one person he ever deferred to; this paternal influence molded the control-obsessed financier who tried to quit banking multiple times but was never allowed to.
• Roosevelt adopted his own father's motto "Get action," channeling extreme energy into public life after personal tragedy — his mother and wife dying on the same day drove him into the Dakota Badlands to rebuild himself through physical hardship.
• Both men were imperious and expected deference; the core tension of the book is that each believed he was the rightful authority over American capitalism.

Morgan's Strategy: Control Through Financial Dependency

• Morgan drew his power not from being the richest man (Rockefeller and Carnegie were wealthier) but from reorganizing failing railroads and industries — poorly run businesses in bad financial positions were the source of his leverage.
• He preferred backroom handshake deals, fixed prices, and suppressed competition to create order, viewing regulation as needless and dangerous to economic growth.
• He never found it necessary to own a majority of shares to exert control; his reputation and influence alone were enough — until E.H. Harriman, a market raider and outsider, dared to buy up Northern Pacific stock and challenge Morgan's dominance.
• The key lesson highlighted: financial strength is "kryptonite to Morgan" — well-run operators like James J. Hill, who built a profitable railroad with deliberate thrift, didn't need Morgan and couldn't be controlled by him.

Roosevelt's Mission: Government as a Check on Big Business

• Roosevelt believed big business was inevitable and essential, but insisted it must be accountable to the public — he saw himself as the public's representative and aimed to ensure laws applied equally to elites and the poor.
• As governor of New York, he signed bills for stricter working-condition regulations, expanded factory inspections, and restricted state employees to 8-hour days, alarming political bosses and wealthy donors who pushed him into the vice presidency to neutralize him.
• His first State of the Union declared that old laws were insufficient for the new industrial age, and he promised the working class that government would not be a spectator — the national government must regulate trusts that operated across state lines.
• Roosevelt masterfully used the press as his ally (the opposite of Morgan's press-avoidance), building public support so overwhelming that the Republican Party couldn't block his reelection despite wanting to.

The Northern Securities Antitrust Battle

• Morgan, Hill, and Harriman formed Northern Securities, a holding company rolling up control of major railroads — exploiting a New Jersey law that permitted one corporation to hold another's stock as a way around the Sherman Antitrust Act.
• Roosevelt had the Department of Justice prosecute Northern Securities without warning Morgan, breaking the unwritten rule that presidents didn't keep secrets from captains of industry — Morgan called Roosevelt "a lunatic" and never forgave him.
• The Supreme Court ultimately ruled Northern Securities illegal, though the practical impact was debatable: Morgan, Hill, and Harriman still owned their individual shares and could collude privately without a formal holding company.
• Roosevelt benefited enormously in public popularity — "people loved him for the enemies he had made" — while Morgan remained pragmatic, donating $100,000 to Roosevelt's reelection campaign to preserve influence.

The Coal Strike Crisis — Forced Cooperation

• In 1902, 147,000 coal miners went on strike for 164 days, threatening a winter without heating fuel; Roosevelt feared starvation, riots, and a crisis rivaling the Civil War.
• Coal mine owners dismissed both the union and Roosevelt, telling the president to mind his own business — Roosevelt realized Morgan had more power in this situation because he had financed the mines.
• Morgan brokered the Corsair Agreement with Roosevelt's cooperation, forcing mine owners back to the table by reminding them the mines belonged to his investors, not to the executives running them.
• The strike's cost was staggering — $74 million to mines and railroads, $25 million in lost wages to miners, $30,000/day for the National Guard — illustrating how two stubborn sides dug in far past the point of rational resolution.

Legacy: Pragmatism Over Rivalry

• Despite their mutual hostility, Roosevelt and Morgan cooperated whenever their interests aligned — their antagonism was real but tempered by pragmatism, as seen during the coal strike and again during the Panic of 1907.
• At age 70, Morgan locked trust company presidents in his library until 4:45 AM, extracting signatures on a $25 million rescue loan that quelled the financial panic — one of the last great displays of his personal power.
• Morgan's final public reflection echoed advice from his father: America's growth would always take care of uncertainty — a belief he held to the end despite much evidence to the contrary.
• The broader takeaway is that the conflict between democratic governance and concentrated financial power is a recurring pattern in history — as the narrator notes, "history doesn't repeat; human nature does."
