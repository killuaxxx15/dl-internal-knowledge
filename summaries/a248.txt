Warren Buffett (The Snowball)

The Compounding Power of Passion and Focus

• From a young age, Buffett displayed an obsessive focus on wealth and business, studying thousands of stocks and reading every biography of people he admired to find life lessons.
• He defined a strict "circle of competence" to avoid mistakes and used almost no debt, choosing to ignore topics like art, literature, and travel to concentrate entirely on his passion.
• Buffett viewed every dollar as a "snowflake" for a compounding "snowball," leading him to live a life of extreme thrift and intellectual intensity.
• His success was powered by an innate intelligence and a temperament that viewed business as a puzzle worth a lifetime of solving.

The Philosophy of the Inner Scorecard

• A foundational lesson Buffett learned from his father, Howard, was to prioritize an "inner scorecard"—being satisfied with your own results rather than worrying about what the world thinks.
• He contrasts this with an "outer scorecard," which he observed in his mother and believed was a path to an unhappy, unfulfilled life.
• This internal focus allowed him to make "maverick" decisions, such as starting a brokerage during the Great Depression or holding onto stocks when others were panicking.
• Buffett applied this to his painting metaphor: he is the artist of his life and business, and he does not care if others would prefer "more red instead of blue".

Business as a Didactic Enterprise

• Buffett considers himself a teacher first, using his annual shareholder letters and public speeches to turn Berkshire Hathaway into an "illustrated text" of his beliefs.
• He and Charlie Munger shared a fascination with studying failure to deduce the rules of success, often utilizing the principle of "invert, always invert".
• Key business lessons he taught included the value of "float" in insurance, the importance of being the low-cost producer, and the power of customer loyalty.
• He emphasized that great societal impact does not always translate to great investments, citing the automobile and airline industries as examples that destroyed investor capital.

The Cost of Obsession on Personal Relationships

• Buffett's relentless focus on work often came at the expense of his family, leading his wife, Susie, to eventually move away to seek her own fulfillment.
• Despite his public praise for her, he admitted he was "95% to 99%" at fault for the rift because he was not attuned to her needs and placed his job first.
• His obsession also meant he neglected personal relationships with his children, failing even to teach them the financial lessons he shared so freely with the public.
• In his later years, Buffett recognized that "sitting in a room making money was no way to spend life" and spent decades trying to repair the damage to his family ties.

Strategic Principles of Investing and Management

• Buffett advocates for a "20-punch" approach to life, suggesting that if you only had 20 major opportunities, you would resist the urge to dabble and only make big, well-researched decisions.
• He values "intensity" as the price of excellence, preferring to do business with relentless individuals who care about every detail, down to the number of sheets on a toilet paper roll.
• A core management principle was the "art of capital allocation"—moving money from less profitable areas to where it would earn the highest return.
• He consistently warned against "acts of omission," believing his biggest mistakes were not the bad deals he made, but the great opportunities he failed to pursue.

The Ultimate Test of a Successful Life

• Toward the end of his life, Buffett redefined success not by net worth, but by how many of the people you want to have love you actually do.
• He noted the "irritating" truth for the wealthy that love cannot be bought with "testimonial dinners" or "hospital wings," but must be earned by being lovable.
• Buffett emphasized that the more love you give away, the more you get, making it the ultimate measure of how one has lived.
• He urged students to work for people they admire and to do what they love, rather than taking jobs just to build a resume.
