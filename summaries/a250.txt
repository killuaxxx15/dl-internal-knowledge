Akio Morita (Sony)

Post-War Resilience and Vision

• In 1946, Akio Morita and Masaru Ibuka founded Sony’s predecessor in a fire-bombed Tokyo department store with the goal of rebuilding Japan's economy through technology.
• Despite the devastation of World War II and Japan's first-ever military defeat, Morita maintained extreme self-confidence and a belief that he had a significant role to play in the future.
• Morita was inspired by American industrial might, such as Ford's manufacturing complexes, and sought to prove that Japan could produce the highest quality goods in the world.

Foundations of Management and Discipline

• Morita was the 15th-generation heir to a sake-brewing family; he learned early business lessons by watching his father restore the family enterprise after it suffered from a lack of focus.
• His management philosophy was shaped by his father’s advice to take full responsibility for decisions and avoid seeking scapegoats when problems arose.
• He emphasized both mental and physical discipline, believing that executives must maintain their health and reflexes through vigorous exercise to stay sharp and confident.

Innovation Through "Pocketable" Technology

• Sony’s strategy focused on miniaturization and compactness, leading to the creation of "pocketable" radios that required customized shirts for salesmen to demonstrate their portability.
• The Walkman, one of Sony's most successful products, was born from co-founder Masaru Ibuka's desire for a portable, private way to listen to music without disturbing others.
• Morita pushed the Walkman to market despite intense internal pushback from accountants and marketing teams who believed a player without recording capabilities would fail.

Marketing as Education and Communication

• Morita believed that for truly innovative products, the company must create the market and educate consumers rather than relying on traditional market research.
• He viewed marketing as a form of communication and insisted on Sony establishing its own distribution outlets to ensure their enthusiasm for the product reached the customer.
• To protect the future value of the brand, Morita famously turned down a massive order for 100,000 radios because the buyer insisted on using their own label instead of Sony's.

Japanese vs. American Management Philosophies

• Morita criticized American management for prioritizing short-term profits and shareholder interests over long-term investment in technology and employees.
• He advocated for the Japanese concept of nemawashi—carefully preparing the groundwork with customers before launching a product, similar to the patient process of transplanting a tree.
• Unlike the hierarchical American model, Morita believed any type of work is honorable and that managers should foster individuality rather than forcing a hollow consensus.

Resourcefulness and the Concept of Mottainai

• A core tenet of Sony’s efficiency was the concept of mottainai, the belief that wasting any resource is a sin because all materials are a "sacred trust".
• Morita viewed technology as a "survival exercise," pushing for low power consumption and extreme efficiency as a necessity for a country with few natural resources.
• He challenged the idea that innovation has peaked, predicting that the future belongs to those who are relentlessly resourceful and efficient with the planet's essentials.
