Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet | The All-In Interview

Google's Position in the AI Landscape

• Sundar emphasizes Google's early commitment to AI, stating that one of his first actions as CEO in 2015 was to position the company as "AI first," following the creation of Google Brain in 2012 and acquisition of DeepMind in 2014.
• He views AI as an "extraordinary opportunity for search" rather than a disruption, noting that AI-powered features like AI Overviews are now used by over 1.5 billion users in 150+ countries and have expanded the types of queries people use.
• Google is testing a new dedicated AI experience called "AI Mode" for search, which enables a "full-on AI experience" including follow-up conversational queries, with users typing queries that are 2-3 times longer than traditional search queries.
• Regarding concerns about the "innovator's dilemma," Pichai argues "the dilemma only exists if you treat it as a dilemma," and that Google's approach is to "lean into" technological innovation "as hard as you can," following the original Google principle: "Follow the user, all else will follow."
• When comparing standalone apps like Gemini to competitors, Pichai notes that AI adoption extends beyond dedicated apps, with search incorporating AI Overviews being one of the most widely used AI products today.

Economics of AI-Powered Search

• Pichai reveals that the cost to serve an AI-powered query has "fallen dramatically in an 18-month time frame," countering early concerns about economics.
• He identifies latency (speed) rather than cost as the primary constraint for AI search implementation, since traditional search is "near instant."
• Regarding ad revenue, Pichai states that with AI Overviews, Google is already "at the baseline" of maintaining comparable revenue to traditional search and expects to improve from there.
• He argues that AI should ultimately do a better job with commercial information (ads) since "commercial information is also information" and users are looking for relevant information when they have commercial intent.
• When asked about pressure from Wall Street during this transition, Pichai focuses on execution: "Are we executing? Are we moving fast? Are we innovating?" noting that Google has "really picked up pace as a company" in the past 12 months.

Google's Infrastructure Advantage

• Pichai positions Google on the "Pareto frontier" of performance and cost, delivering "the best models at the most cost effective price point" due to its infrastructure, including proprietary TPUs (Tensor Processing Units).
• He notes Google is on its seventh generation of TPUs, with the latest "Ironwood" TPU delivering over 40 exaflops per unit, enabling cost efficiency that translates to competitive pricing for products like Gemini 2.5.
• Of Google's approximately $75 billion in 2025 capital expenditure, Pichai reveals that about half of the compute portion will go toward Google Cloud, while the remainder supports innovations in foundation models for text, images, video, and world models.
• While Google trains its Gemini models on TPUs internally, Pichai clarifies they maintain a hybrid approach, also using NVIDIA GPUs, praising NVIDIA's "world class" software stack and Jensen Huang's leadership.
• Pichai sees Google's data advantage in personalization: "With their permission, taking that personal context into account, I think we can deliver much better experiences" using products like Gmail, Calendar, Docs, YouTube, and Search.

Future of Human-Computer Interaction

• Pichai envisions a future where "humans have adapted to computing, and it's always been that way. But over time, the answer will be that you need to do less of the hard work, less of the adaptation, and computing kind of works for you."
• He sees AR glasses as the next significant advancement, stating that when "AR really works" with natively multimodal models processing audio, vision, and language in users' line of view, "that'll wow people."
• Pichai suggests we're "a couple cycles away" from AR glasses reaching their "sweet spot," comparing it to where smartphones were around 2006-2007.
• He confirms Google is "definitely excited about AR/VR glasses, the next form factors," as well as robotics, with Waymo described as "a big robot."

Founder Involvement and Competitors

• Pichai shares that Larry Page and Sergey Brin remain actively involved, with both seeing the current AI era as "the most exciting time in the field." Sergey Brin is "spending time with the Gemini team in a pretty hardcore way, like setting and coding and spending time with the engineers."
• Pichai describes his conversations with the founders as expanding into "nonlinear" thinking that produces interesting ideas, describing their relationship as having "friendship, respect, mutual dialogue."
• When asked about competitors (OpenAI/Sam Altman, XAI/Elon Musk, Meta/Mark Zuckerberg, Microsoft/Satya Nadella), Pichai diplomatically calls them "a very impressive group" and jokes that "maybe only one of them has invited me to a dance, not the others."
• He specifically praises Elon Musk's "ability to build future technologies into existence" as "just unparalleled."
• Pichai views AI as "a much bigger opportunity landscape than all the previous technologies we have known" where multiple companies can succeed through innovation and execution.

Competition from China in AI

• Discussing Chinese AI company DeepSeek, Pichai acknowledges that "we all had to adjust our priors a little bit after the DeepSeek moment," as they proved to be "even closer to the frontier than most people maybe assume."
• While external observers were impressed with DeepSeek's model efficiency, Pichai claims that Google's Flash model "was as efficient or I could argue in some ways better."
• Pichai notes DeepSeek's innovations were driven by working in a "hardware constrained way," and he sees this as evidence that "the frontier is evolving rapidly" with "more players closer to it than people fully realize."
• He states he "always assumed" that "China will be very, very competent on the AI frontier."

Energy Constraints for AI Growth

• Pichai identifies energy as "the most likely constraint for AI progress" and by extension "GDP growth," but characterizes it as "an execution challenge" rather than a fundamental physics problem.
• He advocates for embracing all potential energy innovations, believing solar plus batteries will "end up being huge" alongside nuclear, geothermal, and other sources, while also addressing grid upgrades, transmission, and permitting challenges.
• Pichai identifies workforce constraints as another key challenge, noting the number of electricians leaving the workforce creates a "huge mismatch" with projected demand.
• He confirms Google is already experiencing supply constraints in its cloud business due to "delays in projects because of permitting or not having access to electricians."
• Pichai remains optimistic that the US will "meet the moment" through capitalist innovation, noting that "if we don't, or if the lines don't match, I think the conversations will get louder and louder till we meet the moment."

Future Technologies: Quantum Computing and Robotics

• Pichai compares quantum computing today to where AI was around 2015, predicting that "in a five year timeframe, you would have that moment where a really useful, practical computation is done in a quantum way, far superior to classical computers."
• He believes Google's quantum effort is at the frontier despite industry noise, similar to how Waymo was ahead in self-driving when there were many competitors that appeared comparable.
• For robotics, Pichai states Google has "one of the most advanced frontier R&D teams in the world" with "world class" Gemini robotics efforts around vision, language, and action models.
• He observes rapid progress in humanoid robots, noting that now he has "to take five seconds to look at it and say closely and say, is this fake or is this an actual robot doing it?" compared to obvious limitations in the past.
• Pichai believes we're "probably two to three years away from that magical moment in robotics" and confirms Google's Intrinsic division is effectively developing "the Android for robotics."

Google's Culture and Talent

• Pichai defends Google's employee-focused culture, explaining that perks like free lunches were meant to create "a culture where it's positive, optimistic, you're in an innovation mindset. People are talking to each other...you're cross-pollinating."
• He believes "empowering employees has been and is and will be a source of strength for Google" enabling the company to "attract higher caliber people who feel like they have agency."
• Pichai acknowledges that over time, some focus shifted away from the company's mission, so he's been "very deliberate" about refocusing people on "innovating in the service of the mission" rather than being at the company "to resolve our personal differences."
• He identifies COVID as "such a big distortion to our way of working" since Google's culture was "designed to be a culture in which people were seeing each other, engaging with each other," and returning to a 3-2 hybrid model has helped restore connections.
• On talent recruitment, Pichai sees Google's position as strong despite AI competition, noting they're "both holding on to critical talent" and attracting "the best PhD researchers coming out of the top programs," including some who left and returned.

Alphabet's Structure and Future

• Pichai clarifies that Alphabet is "not a holding company" that simply invests capital in attractive businesses, but rather takes "foundational technology" and identifies problems "in which we can innovate and bring a differentiated value proposition."
• He describes a "common strand" underlying seemingly disparate businesses: "Waymo is going to keep getting better because of the same work we do in Gemini and AI over time as Google Cloud to search to YouTube to isomorphic to robotics."
• Pichai suggests some Alphabet companies may eventually "leave and IPO out because maybe that's the best way they can make progress."
• He confirms that X (formerly Google X) continues as an important innovation incubator, having produced major initiatives including Waymo and early incarnations of Google Brain.
• When asked about regrets, Pichai mentions "acquisitions we debated hard, came close" to making, specifically naming Netflix as one the company "debated super intensely inside."
