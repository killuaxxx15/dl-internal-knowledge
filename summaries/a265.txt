Chung Ju-yung founder of Hyundai (the most inspiring autobiography I’ve read)

The Bulldozer Philosophy: Thorough Planning Meets Bold Execution

• Chung earned the "bulldozer" nickname not from recklessness, but from meticulous planning followed by decisive implementation that appeared sudden to outsiders.
• He spent enormous time analyzing and planning every detail before execution, rejecting the idea that lack of formal education meant lack of wisdom.
• When experts declared projects "impossible" (highways, shipyards, heavy equipment transport), he pushed forward by thinking harder and working harder than others.
• His motto was "shorten the time" and "if you search for a method, it will come to you"—believing strong will unleashes unlimited potential.

Building From Extreme Poverty to National Infrastructure

• Started as a poor farmer's son working grueling hours from age 10, later moved to the city with no education, connections, or resources.
• Built Hyundai into one of the world's most successful companies while constructing much of Korea's physical infrastructure and landmarks.
• Faced constant near-disasters, including nearly drowning in 1973 when his jeep fell into the sea during shipyard construction amid crushing debt.
• Self-educated through voracious reading after only six years of formal schooling, considering books his "second mentors" after his parents.

Finding Heaven in Daily Hardship Through Positive Disposition

• Possessed an extraordinary ability to "accentuate the positive rather than the negative" even in dire circumstances.
• Described breaks from backbreaking farm labor as "like heaven" and woke each morning "ready to go" despite exhaustion.
• Never complained despite working with an empty stomach, watching food he couldn't afford, and facing humiliation and defeat throughout his career.
• Believed 90% of his 80 years were "full of joy and meaning" because he lived fully in the present while dreaming of a brighter future.

Distaste for Waste and Luxury as Business Principle

• Maintained rigorous frugality throughout his success, viewing waste as antithetical to business survival.
• Observed that no company thrives under luxury-loving, wasteful ownership, while countless companies have been ruined by such management.
• Contrasted this with examples like Henry Ford's grandson prioritizing customer convenience over company interests.
• Emphasized that special founders who built century-lasting companies shared this fundamental aversion to waste.

Diligence as the Foundation of a Full Life

• Argued that lazy people complain of tiredness and boredom, while diligent people live 100 times more productive and fulfilling lives.
• Stated "people must work to live a full life"—daily diligence brings restful sleep, monthly diligence improves quality of life, lifelong diligence brings recognition.
• Believed diligence forces movement, thought, and work, mirroring one's sincerity about living fully.
• Explicitly stated "I don't trust anyone who is lazy," viewing diligence as the first recommendation for anyone not wanting to waste time.

Success Through Positive Attitude and Personal Responsibility

• Defined living well not by circumstances, position, or profession, but by giving one's best and living fully in the present.
• Emphasized that everyone—from delivery workers to executives—can find success and respect through positive thinking and open-hearted living.
• Asserted that while birth circumstances vary, the future is determined solely by individual effort and personal responsibility.
• Believed positive attitudes led every major achievement and that daily self-improvement gives life its meaning.
