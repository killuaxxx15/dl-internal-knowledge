The Big Rich (Oil Billionaires)

Spindletop and the Birth of the Modern Oil Era

• The Lucas #1 well at Spindletop, Texas produced more oil than all other American wells combined, and within days surpassed the entire world's output.
• The oil's poor quality (unfit for kerosene) accidentally accelerated its adoption — railroads, navies, and industries converted from coal to oil because it was so cheap and abundant.
• Spindletop became the origin point for everything that runs on oil today: automobiles, jet fighters, furnaces, and beyond.

The Four Patriarchs: Self-Made Billionaires from Nothing

• Roy Cullen, H.L. Hunt, Clint Murchison, and Sid Richardson — the "Big 4" — all started in obscurity and built their fortunes during a remarkable four-year window through sheer persistence and luck.
• Their lives were defined by excess: private islands, mansions, football teams, political influence, affairs with movie stars, and attempts to corner global markets.
• What united them was not just oil, but a uniquely Texan identity — loud, boisterous, proud, and fiercely independent.

Clint Murchison: The Visionary Diversifier

• Murchison was the earliest to recognize that Texas oil dominance would fade as cheaper Middle Eastern and African production rose, and aggressively diversified into railroads, insurance, and other industries.
• Described by the New York Times as a "one-man conglomerate," he tore through life with gusto and was beloved by all who knew him.
• He died of pneumonia in June 1969, with his obituary running on the front page of the New York Times.

H.L. Hunt: The Controversial Giant

• Hunt was the most contradictory of the four — brilliant and ruthless in business, deeply flawed personally, and famously eccentric.
• His Texas Monthly obituary called him "many men in one," comparing him to an Ayn Rand character: a rogue who broke rules on a grand scale.
• He died in November 1974 after collapsing at his desk, his passing marking the symbolic end of the original oilmen's era.

Roy Cullen and Sid Richardson: Loyalty and Friendship

• Cullen, who donated 93% of his fortune before death, spent his final years with his wife Lilly — who had stood by him through decades of poverty — watching deer on their ranch and surrounded by grandchildren.
• Richardson and Murchison began each day at 5 a.m. with a phone call to each other, spending an hour discussing investments and crops — a friendship that outlasted their business partnership.
• Richardson died of a heart attack in his sleep in 1959 at age 68; Cullen died in 1957 after a stroke, with Lilly passing two years later, never adapting to his absence.

The Second Generation: Triumph of the Bass Family, Failure of the Rest

• Most second-generation heirs squandered their fortunes on football teams, cocaine, and reckless spending — the Murchison heir is explicitly described as having "one good decision and a thousand bad ones."
• The Bass family (heirs to Sid Richardson) stood apart: guided by sharp investor Richard Rainwater, they bought undervalued oil company stocks, flipped them for hundreds of millions, then invested $500 million in Walt Disney at $55/share.
• By the early 1990s, that Disney stake was worth $2.8 billion — growing the Bass fortune from $50 million to $5 billion in 16 years, one of the greatest investment runs of the 20th century.
