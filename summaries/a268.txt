Billy Durant (Creator of General Motors)

Durant's Paradoxical Genius and Tragic Legacy

• Billy Durant founded or significantly influenced three of four major American auto manufacturers (GM, Chrysler, and Frigidaire), yet died broke at 78 operating a bowling alley, borrowing money from his daughter.
• His greatest strength—unbridled optimism and daring vision—became his fatal weakness, as he gambled everything repeatedly without protecting his downside.
• Despite his enormous contributions to the automobile industry, Durant remains largely forgotten compared to Henry Ford or Alfred P. Sloan, serving as a cautionary tale about the consequences of unchecked risk-taking.
• Unlike other automotive pioneers who were tinkerers, Durant was an organizational genius who assembled companies with legendary charm and vision, making him the most likable figure among early auto entrepreneurs.

Early Success Through Organization and Vision

• Durant's grandfather, Governor Crapo, was a lumber baron who amassed significant wealth in Flint, Michigan, establishing the family's business foundation and political connections.
• Durant built his first fortune in the carriage business before automobiles, demonstrating exceptional sales ability and organizational skills rather than mechanical expertise.
• He recognized automobiles' potential early and assembled General Motors by acquiring and consolidating multiple car companies, creating the largest industrial corporation in world history.
• His soft-spoken sales approach and ability to inspire loyalty made him an adored leader who could convince others to follow his ambitious visions.

The Fatal Pattern: Betting Everything During Financial Panics

• Durant's downfall followed a consistent pattern—he could only succeed in boom times and was completely unprepared for inevitable economic downturns ("the unusual happens usually").
• During the 1920 recession, GM's sales plummeted from 47,000 to 12,000 cars monthly, but Durant personally bought stock trying to support the price instead of protecting his capital.
• He lost $90 million personally while trying to save friends and investors from ruin, even when he faced bankruptcy himself—a noble but financially catastrophic decision.
• Durant kept no records of his personal debts, couldn't determine the extent of his liabilities, and had to take days to get reports from brokers, showing shocking financial mismanagement.

Relationships with Legendary Auto Executives

• Durant recruited and worked with three automotive giants—Charles Nash, Walter Chrysler, and Alfred P. Sloan—all of whom left GM due to disagreements with his management style.
• Despite acrimonious departures, all three men remained friends with Durant for life and praised him in their autobiographies, with Chrysler calling him "a genius" whom "the automobile industry owes more to than it has yet acknowledged."
• Durant paid Chrysler $10 million for his stock when he left (after Chrysler started at $6,000/year), demonstrating generosity even as his own finances deteriorated.
• These strong-willed executives couldn't function as "yes men" under Durant's dominant style, yet respected his vision and contributions to the industry.

The Two Catastrophic Losses of Control

• Durant lost control of GM twice—first in 1910 after financial struggles during his rapid expansion phase, then permanently in 1920 when the post-WWI recession devastated the company.
• The Morgan banking syndicate and du Pont family orchestrated both rescues, but Durant believed they had "hustled him" out of his stock, particularly after insider Ed Stettinius sold 125,000 shares short.
• Durant raised capital under increasingly worse terms—paying $9 million in commissions on a $12 million raise in 1910, though later deals were better structured.
• His distrust of bankers from the 1910 experience made him vulnerable in 1920, yet he made it "easy for them to hustle him" through reckless personal stock purchases.

Protection of Others Over Self-Preservation

• Durant exhibited an uncommon attitude among wealthy businessmen—he prioritized protecting his investors and friends even when it meant his own financial ruin.
• When associates who bought GM stock on his advice faced losses, Durant offered to buy their shares despite being in severe trouble himself, consistent with his character from earlier business ventures.
• He attempted to support GM's stock price to ensure British and Canadian investment syndicates wouldn't renege on their commitments, sacrificing personal wealth for the company's survival.
• His loyal biographer noted that had Durant not become involved in market speculation, he would have been worth $500 million and still controlled GM, but his daring, impulsive nature was inseparable from his success.
