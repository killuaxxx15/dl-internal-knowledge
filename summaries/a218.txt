How to Write Truly Great Characters — Jonathan Franzen

Character Construction and the "Comic Problem"

• Franzen constructs main characters by looking for a single sentence that describes a problem for them, ideally one that elicits a smile or laugh from the reader.
• Effective dramatic tension arises when characters simply want different things, such as one person wanting to board a plane and another refusing to do so.
• The problems do not need to be high-stakes global crises; often, trivial or small problems are funnier and sufficient to set the story in motion if the character cares deeply about them.
• While main characters require deep attention, secondary characters are functional and can be defined quickly by their dramatic role within the story.

The Necessity of Humor and Narrative Distance

• There is a false prejudice that "serious" novelists cannot be funny, yet the vast majority of great playwrights and novelists throughout history utilized humor.
• A critical indicator of a writer’s success is "distance," specifically the ability to laugh at the protagonist rather than being personally implicated in their struggles.
• Franzen advises against writing from a perspective of unexamined victimhood, noting that if an author believes their character is solely a "good person" victimized by "bad people," the narrative lacks necessary nuance.

Managing Shame and Self-Projection in Fiction

• To infuse personal subjectivity into a story, it is often easier to create a character superficially unlike the author (e.g., a different gender) to bypass the inhibition of writing about oneself.
• Writers often hit a wall when the story demands they go in a direction that induces personal shame, causing the writing to become depressed, unfunny, or depraved.
• Resolving this block requires deep self-analysis to understand the source of the shame, eventually allowing the writer to view the shameful element as ridiculous or objective material.

Stylistic Rigor and Maintaining the "Vivid Dream"

• The writer’s goal is to create a "vivid dream" for the reader, which is easily broken by technical insufficiencies or self-conscious, experimental gimmicks.
• Clichés must be strictly avoided because they signal laziness and inattention, causing the reader to lose trust in the writer’s authority.
• Descriptive economy is essential; a writer does not need excessive details (like constant weather reports) because the reader’s imagination eagerly fills in the gaps to form a complete picture.

The Organic Writing Process vs. Planning

• Franzen avoids outlining because he believes a fully planned book feels sterile to the reader; he prefers the adventure of making an unlikely sequence of events feel inevitable.
• His daily routine involves laboriously rewriting and polishing the previous day's small output (e.g., 200 words) to build a solid "iron bridge" before adding a single new page.
• The most critical breakthrough in the writing process is discovering the specific "tone" of the book—once the ironic or comic spin of the sentences is found, the work accelerates.


The Purpose of Fiction and Societal Critique

• While he once sought political justifications for his work, Franzen now believes the ultimate purpose of writing is to create and provide pleasure, even in politically fraught times.
• He identified the dangers of the internet and "big tech" early on, driven by a deep distrust of consumer capitalism and the "beautiful lies" of corporations claiming to make the world better.
• His fiction focuses on family dynamics because, unlike the curated and avoidable interactions of digital life, family relationships force high-stakes, inescapable, real-time engagement.
