Walt Disney (Disneyland)

Walt Disney's Vision for Disneyland Was Universally Rejected

• In the early 1950s, Disney envisioned an immersive theme park on 240 acres in Anaheim, California — opposed by his brother Roy, bankers, and his wife Lillian.
• Amusement parks were considered a despised, financially ruinous business at the time.
• Disney initially financed the project against his own life insurance policy, driven purely by personal conviction.

A Difficult, Joyless Childhood Shaped Disney's Drive

• Disney grew up with an austere, emotionally cold father who withheld praise and basic comforts; his mother secretly buttered his bread on the bottom to hide the "luxury."
• At age 9, Disney was waking at 3:30 AM to deliver newspapers in the snow, finding joy only in playing briefly with toys left on porches.
• His harsh upbringing likely fueled his later obsession with creating joy and wonder for others.

Disney Was a Fanatical, Obsessive Builder — Not a Consensus Designer

• The host places Disney alongside Steve Jobs, Enzo Ferrari, and Henry Royce as entrepreneurs defined by uncompromising product standards.
• Disneyland was described as "the extension of a powerful personality of one man," not a committee-designed experience.
• Disney assembled engineers, architects, animators, and artists to execute his vision with only a year and a day to build the entire park.

Opening Day Was a Spectacular Disaster

• July 17, 1955 saw massive crowds, running out of food and water, stuck heels in unhardened asphalt, a gas leak, a boat running off its track, and the worst traffic in Orange County history.
• Disney was reportedly "nearly suicidal with grief" believing he had failed publicly and on a grand scale.
• Despite the chaos, the crowds kept coming — and Disney immediately reframed the park as a "living thing" to be continuously improved.

"Plusing" — Disney's Philosophy of Constant Improvement

• Disney coined the term "plusing" to describe his commitment to endlessly improving Disneyland, viewing it as fundamentally different from a finished film.
• He saw Disneyland as "something alive" that would outlive him and keep growing — unlike a movie that cannot be changed once released.
• This philosophy extended to his even grander ambitions for Disney World, which he was designing up to his final days.

Disney Worked Until His Final Breath

• A lifelong chain smoker, Disney was diagnosed with lung cancer and had his entire left lung removed, yet returned to work two weeks later.
• His last known project was a mockup for an improved moon trip attraction; his final goodbye to a beloved animator was noted as the first time he'd ever said it.
• Disney died still envisioning a much larger future, leaving Disney World — which would span 40,000+ acres — unrealized in his lifetime.
