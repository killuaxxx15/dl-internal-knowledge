HOW TO THRIVE NO MATTER WHAT W/ ARNOLD VAN DEN BERG

One-Pointedness and Flow States: The Key to Exceptional Performance

• Arnold discovered that extreme mental focus (called "ekagrata" or one-pointedness by yogis) and flow states are the foundation of extraordinary achievement, whether in survival situations, athletics, or investing
• His father survived Auschwitz death marches by focusing entirely on moving his legs, discovering that concentrated focus paradoxically generated energy despite extreme weakness
• Scientific studies show that achieving flow states releases seven neurochemicals including dopamine, endorphins, and serotonin, creating optimal conditions for performance while reducing pain and enhancing creativity
• Athletes and concentration camp survivors alike accessed these states through intense focus, demonstrating that mental control can override physical limitations and enable peak performance

Hypnosis as a Practical Tool for Achieving Flow

• Self-hypnosis can induce theta brainwave states (4-7 hertz) in just 7-11 minutes, providing reliable access to flow states that athletes might only experience 2-3% of the time by chance
• Arnold learned self-hypnosis in 10 days using Leslie LeCron's book, initially to combat afternoon fatigue, finding that 20-30 minutes equaled three hours of sleep
• The Silva Method offers a simple approach: count backwards from 100 to 1 while relaxing, gradually reducing to 50-1, then 25-1, eventually reaching alpha state by counting just 5 to 1
• Arnold used hypnosis to help his son win a championship shot put competition while wearing a cast on a sprained ankle, throwing six inches farther than his personal best

The Subconscious Mind as Programmable Computer

• The subconscious accepts everything without judgment, analysis, or questioning—whatever you repeatedly tell it becomes your reality
• Repetition is the key mechanism: advertisers exploit this by repeating messages that bypass conscious resistance and directly program the subconscious
• Arnold transformed his life by programming affirmations: "I am a loving, kind person and I'm happy, healthy, wealthy and wise," repeated constantly during daily activities
• He overcame a psychological block preventing conception by using hypnosis to identify and remove the subconscious programming from his mother's warnings about having children

Practical Breathing Techniques for Health and Mental Clarity

• The average person breathes 16 times per minute (a state of anxiety), while optimal breathing is 5 times per minute; yogis achieve one breath per minute
• Dr. Weil's 4-7-8 technique: breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, exhale for 8 seconds—this creates 3 breaths per minute and helps access alpha states
• Arnold doubled his lung capacity at age 86 through breath work, going from 2,200 to 4,500 milliliters despite typical age-related decline
• Lung capacity is the single greatest determinant of longevity and wellness according to top scientists—more important than diet or general exercise

Investment Philosophy: Positioning for Currency Depreciation

• Arnold sees the market as 25% more overvalued than ever before, with US debt of $38 trillion requiring continued money printing that will depreciate the dollar
• His strategy focuses on commodities trading at historic lows: natural gas at $3 should be $10 based on oil equivalence, gold and silver as central banks shift from treasuries
• He recommends 15-20% cash for buying opportunities, sector funds like the Goering Fund for commodity exposure, and short-term treasury bonds (under 3 years maximum)
• Avoid leverage and debt entirely, stay away from overvalued indices, and focus on companies producing real commodities rather than futures

Character and Truth as Foundation for Success

• Dostoevsky learned in the Gulag that character determines survival—those with the highest character endured inhumanity best
• His principle "above all, do not lie" is critical: lying destroys your ability to discern truth in yourself and others, leading to loss of self-respect and ultimately the ability to love
• For investors, the ability to discern truth is the most critical skill—more important than intelligence or education
• True happiness comes not from money or achievement but from unconditional giving and sharing knowledge without expectation of return
