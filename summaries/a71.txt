Ending the ICE age: Kunal Khattar on the trillion dollar EV opportunity in India

Advantage Founders' Investment Philosophy

• Founded by Kunal Khattar after his experience with Carnation Auto, focusing on creating "100 successful founders" as their North Star metric
• Operates as a sector-focused fund specializing in EV and mobility, with team members called "invest-a-preneurs" rather than traditional titles
• Targets the "zero to one" journey, investing in pre-seed/seed rounds with high conviction but smaller checks
• Fund three will be $75 million, maintaining discipline to avoid over-capitalization and focus on 3-4 investments per year

The Trillion-Dollar EV Opportunity ("Suzuki 2.0")

• Compares the current EV transition to Suzuki's ICE ecosystem development in India since 1985, which created over $1 trillion in market cap
• The original Suzuki ecosystem spawned component manufacturers, dealerships, financing, insurance, and energy distribution worth hundreds of billions
• EV transition will disrupt and recreate similar value chains, potentially generating another trillion dollars in market cap over 30-40 years
• Advantage positions itself as funding the "picks and shovels" companies - the infrastructure builders enabling this transition

Commercial Vehicle Electrification Priority

• Only 10% of Indian vehicles are commercial, but they consume 70% of energy and contribute 70% of vehicular pollution
• Electrifying commercial vehicles would save $150 billion in crude oil imports annually and significantly reduce pollution
• Commercial vehicles offer better ROI due to 5-10x higher usage than personal vehicles, making EV economics more compelling
• Focus on income-generating assets creates better operating leverage and faster payback periods for businesses

India's Unique EV Ecosystem

• India is primarily a two-wheeler, three-wheeler, and commercial vehicle market, unlike the four-wheeler-focused US and China
• Building world-class companies in form factors where India already leads (two-wheelers, three-wheelers, buses, trucks) rather than copying Western models
• Form factors like e-rickshaws, two-wheeler taxis, and buses are more affordable and suitable for Indian income levels
• Asset-light shared mobility models across these form factors can serve hundreds of millions of users profitably

Investment Timing and J-Curve Strategy

• Emphasizes investing in sectors 3-5 years before J-curve growth, avoiding both too-early and too-late entry
• Previously invested in shared mobility (2015) when it was at ground zero, now focusing on EV as stars have aligned post-COVID
• Key indicators for EV timing: lithium-ion prices dropped 90% in 10 years, infrastructure development, and government support
• No longer investing in shared mobility as companies like Rapido are now $300-500 million valuations, making entry too expensive

Technology Solutions and Portfolio Examples

• Exponent Energy solves the three main EV adoption barriers: cost, range anxiety, and charging behavior through 15-minute charging
• Companies like Rapido (unicorn bike taxi), Chalo (public transport digitization), and Moon Rider (electric tractors) represent category leaders
• Zeno motorcycle built specifically for bike taxi drivers based on Rapido's requirements, showing ecosystem collaboration
• Focus on B2B businesses requiring less capital but superior technology, leveraging deep sector expertise

Future Technology Outlook

• Hydrogen technology is 15-20 years away from mainstream adoption, similar to where EVs were 20 years ago
• Solid-state batteries and other advanced technologies may not be suitable for India's different form factors and price sensitivity
• India should focus on indigenous technology development suited to local needs rather than blindly copying Western innovations
• Energy will become a commodity like capital, with unified energy interface (UEI) enabling trading similar to UPI in payments

Fund Strategy and LP Base

• Retained 100% of LPs from previous funds, with anchor investors including Motherson, Hero Group, and family offices
• First close focused on domestic capital, expanding to global institutional investors for remaining capital
• Collaborates extensively with other funds rather than competing, recognizing the need for collective ecosystem building
• Hands off portfolio companies to larger funds at Series B/C stage, focusing on their core competency in early-stage development
