The HP Way: How Bill Hewlett and I Built Our Company

Origins and Early Philosophy

• David Packard and Bill Hewlett founded HP in 1938 after studying at Stanford under Professor Terman, who encouraged their entrepreneurial ambitions despite the Great Depression
• They flipped a coin to decide the company name, designated their first product "Model 200A" to appear established, and mailed brochures to just 25 potential customers
• First full year (1939) generated $5,369 in sales with $1,563 profit—humble beginnings for what became a multibillion-dollar company
• Early versatility was crucial: founders handled everything from product development to bookkeeping to "sweeping up at the end of the day"

Financial Discipline and Growth Strategy

• Packard's father was a bankruptcy referee during the Depression—he observed that overleveraged companies lost everything while debt-free firms survived with assets intact
• HP adopted a strict no long-term debt policy, financing growth through earnings rather than borrowing, inspired by General Radio's success with this approach
• A banker's advice stuck with Packard: "More businesses die from indigestion than starvation"—warning against overextension
• Profit defined as "the value we add to the resources we utilize," representing what customers willingly pay above costs

The HP Way: Core Management Principles

• HP developed a distinctive management style combining values, corporate objectives, and practices that became known as "The HP Way"
• Maintained narrow focus on complementary measurement and testing products rather than pursuing unrelated opportunities, even declining large wartime contracts outside their expertise
• Company culture emphasized decentralization, giving operating units freedom to make decisions rather than creating bureaucratic committees
• Applied "steady, gentle pressure" to management—a lesson from cattle ranching about avoiding both panic and complacency

People-Centered Practices

• During the 1970 recession, HP avoided layoffs by implementing a 10% pay cut with corresponding 10% reduction in work hours (9-day fortnight) for six months across all levels
• Emphasized hiring capable people and continuous education since "techniques that are relevant today will be outdated in the future"
• Celebrated employees who left to start successful companies (creating 40,000+ jobs), viewing it as validation of HP's entrepreneurial principles
• Chuck House defied orders to discontinue a display monitor, resulting in $35 million in sales—later received a medal for "Extraordinary Contempt and Defiance"

Crisis and Recovery in the 1990s

• By 1990, HP faced paralysis from excessive centralization and committee-driven decision-making, influenced by trying to emulate IBM's structure for the computer business
• Twenty years of slow bureaucratic buildup caused decision cycles to balloon and stock to fall to $25/share
• Packard and Hewlett personally visited facilities, systematically eliminated management layers, disbanded committees, and restored decentralized authority
• Reorganization restored agility—stock recovered to $70/share by 1993

Vision for the Future

• HP took 40 years to reach $1 billion in sales but added $5 billion in a single year (1994) with minimal inflation
• Spent $2 billion annually on new product development, generating $6 profit over 5-6 years for every dollar invested in R&D
• Emphasized creating products that make "real contributions to technology, not products that copy what someone else has done"
• Optimistic about the 21st century as an era where new products would contribute to better lives globally, beyond just information technology
